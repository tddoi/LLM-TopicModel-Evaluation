Ah, but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and
a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time, but it happens
when there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often).  This sense creates
drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's
attention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about
(here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a
sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/
touch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of ""dead time"" with the
players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the
mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher
who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans
will appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring.
At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid
fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on
T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major
League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of
shortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because ""football has more
action than baseball"".

Perhaps one other thing I should have added is that Jeremiah's prophesies
about the coming destruction of Jerusalem would have been understood by
the people of that time to be a full frontal assault on their understanding
of their relationship with the Lord. Today the if the general populace 
hears ""prophesies"" like the Portland earthquake or New York will burn
ones, they are unlikely to see it in the context of their relationship
(or lack of it) with the Lord. They are far more likely to think that
they are just the result of the fevered imaginations of a religious nutter.
That is one reason why I am always deep;y suspicious of bald judgement
prophesies without any explanation of the reasons for the judgement. This
doesn't have to be long winded. To see a relatively modern example look
at Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural speech. The relevant section is
below. It is this type of spiritual insight which was missing in both
prophesies posted here.

--- Excerpt from Abraham Lincoln's 2nd Inaugural speech----

Both read the same Bible, and pray 
to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other. It may seem 
strange that any men should dare to ask a just God's assistance in wringing 
their bread from the sweat of other men's faces; but let us judge not
that we be not judged. The prayers of both could not he answered that of neither
has been answered fully. The Almighty has His own purposes. ''Woe unto the
world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to
that man by whom the offence cometh"" If we shall suppose that American 
Slavery is one of those offences which, in the provdence of God, must needs come
but which, having  continued through  His appointed time, He now wills to remove
and that He gives to both North and South, this terrible war, as the woe due to
those by whom the offence came, shall we discern therein an departure from
those divine attribute which the believers in a Living God always  ascribe 
to Him ? Fondly do we hope - fervently do we pray - that this mighty 
scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, 
until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of 
unrequited  toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn  with 
the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three 
thousand  years ago, so still it must be said ""the judgments of the Lord, 
are true and righteous altogether""
  With malice toward none; with charity for all;  with firmness in the right, 
as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we 
are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have 
borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan - to do all which 
may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, 
and with all nations.

And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus
himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than
heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new
churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev,
chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word
""throne"" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the
assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are
already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.  There is no
recourse, excuse or defense.

Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to
extremes before stopping at ""moderation.""  I think we have seen the extreme of
the ""hell fire & brimstone"" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme
where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones
sensibilities.

I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a
story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the
point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed
everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to
pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man
wouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in
hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't
exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't
exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And
yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.

I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. 
When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that
isn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. 
It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the
surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which
is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness
which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life,
then broad is the way to distruction.

>
>Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are 
>afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?

I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all,
repentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from!
No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we
should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  

I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I
would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its
eternality.

1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness.
2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature.
   If responsible, then he is also accountable.
3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God.
4) Christ.  He was willing to die and go there Himself to offer an avenue to
   the ""whosoever will.""

Organization: The World Public Access UNIX, Brookline, MA
Lines: 32


I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as
a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as ""foo.txt ."" I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
""foo.txt"" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems.

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move ""foo.txt"" to a specified directory, rename it using
the current date and time, and delete the original ""foo.txt .""

In other words, ""foo.txt"" gets renamed as ""5012300"", say, on May 1
at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and
""foo.txt"" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec
macro points to it.

My main question is this: 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
time/date variable in the new filename?

Okay, this is a long shot.

My friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very  
regularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a  
number of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have  
said either ""You have mono"" or ""You're full of it; there's nothing wrong  
with you.""  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her,  
and one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome.

Now, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  
it exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the  
story?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be real?

Has anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live  
with?  Thanks for your assistance.

I use an H11F1   FET optoisolater to switch microphone level signals.
There is no click, since I put a .1uF cap across the LED.  Distortion
measurement are very low with mic level, and they went up to 0.03% at a
+ 14 dB line level.  All I did was put the FET in series with one leg
of the balanced line.  No hums, pops, just audio jumping out of silence.
The FET runs about 100 million ohms with the LED dark and drops to 150-200
ohms with it on.

Hey, it works, and works well.

My knowledge about driving in the U.S. is also second-hand, but I think I can
correct your statements about our Autobahn:

>1. Drivers are much better disciplined in Europe than they are here.

Oh yeah, that would be paradise... in fact, you can forget it. From all I've
heard from my U.S. relatives, drivers esp. here in Germany are much more agg-
ressive, but not disciplined. One of my relatives, a L.A. resident, hired a car
at the Nuernberg airport and went about 18 miles to our home. He said then that
he grew about 1 year older during this ride and swore he'd never drive a car in
Germany again (this was in 1982 and he kept his promise - the situation now is
even worse as effect of the increased volume of traffic).
What you mean by `better disciplined' should perhaps be considered `cautious due
to fear': 
When driving around here, you always *have* to take into consideration that the
majority of the other drivers absolutely relies on you: They expect that nobody
fails or sleeps; many of them exploit this by driving as fast as their car can
go (of course only where that is allowed, you might think - dream on :).
So any mistake you make is a very high risk to your health - and if you're ex-
posed to such a situation from your very first day as a driver, you learn to
handle it - or you lose... 
That's the way I and most people I know experience our traffic situation - 
whether you think this is pleasant or efficient is up to you; I think we handle
a very high volume of traffic and that at high speeds with modest (compared to
the volume) and decreasing rates of lethal accidents - OTOH, more and more
people (esp. women) dislike driving (because they feel overtaxed and threatened)
and each accident is one accident too much.

>2. The roads comprising the Autobahn are much better designed than

>   far more predictable than most US highways.

Better designed and maintained, may be - but animal fences are very rare. Auto-
bahnen and many other streets have guard-rails (I hope that's the right word - 
a plank made from thick steel sheet fixed on uprights; it's about 2 feet high);
those guard-rails are designed for keeping vehicles on the road. Smaller animals
can crawl under the plank, bigger ones can easily jump over it. The point is
that esp. larger animals are very rare in Germany; they tend also to be very
timid. Accidents caused by animals are a neglegible danger.

You're right (there are speed linits even on the major part of the Autobahn) -
but the attitude towards driving (see above) seems to be very similar to that
in Germany (I've been in France, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, Spain, Belgium,
the Netherlands) - besides that, you really can't rely on the residents abiding
the local speed limits. I've got quite a lot of practise (~120k miles) and I'm
used to travel at 130 mph (FYI, with a car even smaller than a rabbit), but I
consider driving on the highways round Paris or Milano really a thrill...

>I strongly suspect you won't find a lot of Rabbit owners doing 120mph
>(nearly 200km/h) on the Autobahn, but I could be wrong. ...

Sorry, but you'll find quite a lot rabbit-class-car (or even smaller, mine is a
Peugeot 205) owners going that fast; small cars with much HP are very `hip' over
here - and most people buying such cars aren't afraid to let them run.

I disagree; the size or weight of a car is rather irrelevant. Formula-1 cars
weigh less than 700 kg and the drivers have a chance to survive accidents at
130 mph or higher - OTOH when crashing against a solid object at 130 mph,
it makes no difference whether you sit in a Porsche, a Mercedes, a tank or on
a bicycle: Your're dead.

The donations are tax deductible like any donations to a non-profit
organization.  I've donated money to a group restoring streetcars
and it was tax deductible.  Why don't you contribute to a group
helping the homeless if you so concerned?

I have owned my Sprint from the beginning and that sensor light comes on every
30K to let you know it's time for a check up.  When that light goes on, I just
take it to the delaer tell them ""It's that time"" and they work on it for 4 hou
and you pay $5 for parts and $100 for labor. (Ahh...what they get for labor)
I currently have about 95K on my Sprint and of all the times I took it in for
service, I never say on the payment sheet anything about the replacement of the
Oxygen sensor.  What the heck is an Oxygen sensor?  As far an I know of, I have
never had that thing replaced in my car and the car is purring like a kitten.
Now, I don't have a/c (Mother Nature does that for me :-) ) and that might have
something to do with it, but I still never heard of an Oxygen sensor.  The only
MAJOR service job I have had on my car (besides getting the tires replaced
if you want to call that a service job) was getting the Rotor, Distributor and
Gasket replaced.  And that was all done within the past 2 months.  

What I do at 30K is have a good tune-up, let them replace what ever they need
to, pay the bill (about $125) and go home and don't worry about the car for
another 30K.  Oh, I just remembered something.  If that little sensor light
bothers you, in the fuse box right below the turn-signal lever up against
the dash, there is a swith on the right side.  Flip that switch and the light
will go off.  I do that so that little light won't annoy me.  If you can't
find it, look it up in the car manuel.  I hope that I have helped a little
and good luck with the _Oxygen sensor_?

Please, leave heaven out of it.  For his own sake, I pray that Dan does

your view of many groups appears correct from my point of view.

Dan, I'm familiar with this one.  You've got a point, though.  There are
some who don't want to turn over everything and be a disciple, some have
no clue about it because they've not been taught, some have done exactly
that and turned over everything to follow Jesus, some are blocked by
difficult doctrine taught by uncaring Pharisees and teachers of the law.
However, Jesus pointed out what it takes to follow him and to be his
disciple in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  My question is:  why do
people ignore the command and treat it as optional?  I certainly don't
have an answer to this.

My parents had nothing to do with it.  God had and has everything to do
with it.  As for these attacking responses, I must say that I disagree
with your tone and what appears to be some very judgmental statements
(possibly to the point of slander) when talking about people, not what
they do.  Please, if you have a response, state it instead of flying off

Some thoughts and facts,

1.)  Bill James is a partial owner of STATS, inc.  However he has almost
nothing to do with the day-to-day operations of the company, although he
does have significant input into the design of the books that bear his name.
(The handbook, but not the scoreboard).  To the best of my knowledge, the
only things that Bill actually writes for STATS are the predictions section
of the handbook, and the Bill James Fantasy Baseball rulebook.

2.) The debate over Elias goes way back.  Bill James' early stuff was hampered
by the fact that Elias would not give access to their stats at any price.
Project Scoresheet, and later, STATS were founded to fill this void.  You
can call STATS, and ask them for a report on just about anything in their
database, and they will provide it -- for a price, of course.  Or you could
just log into their online system and look at the data yourself.  Having
attempted to pry numbers from Elias in the past (football, not baseball), they
just don't do that.  In STATS eyes, the high ground comes from making the
information available at all.

3.)  That being said, I'm pretty dissapointed by Bill's book this year, too.
I am given to understant that it was mostly a response to the publishers 
desire to have the book come out sooner than April.

Hope this makes things just a little bit clearer.

(Bias alert.  I am a former part-time employee of STATS.)

But you haven't taken into the account of propoganda.  Remember, if you
asked Germans before WWII if the Jews shoudl be slaughtered, they would
probably answer no, but, after the propoganda machine rolled through, at
least some were able to tolerate it.

Well, they haven't managed to outlaw abortion due to the possible objectivity
of the courts.  But, they have managed to create quite a few problems for
people that wanted to have an abortion.  They could create similar problems
for us.  And, it could be worse.  They can try to stop abortions by blocking

Yes, I'd be glad if it were gone to.  I've never supported it.  However,

Well, I am not clear on the religious convictions of Francis Scott Key (the
motto can be attributed to him), but it is at least clear that he believed
in a god.  And, surely there are a few Christians that think as you say,
but I don't think that most do.  Do you think that all Christians actively
despise other religions?  Most that I have met haven't and don't do so.

Well, I have asked a Hindu, Moselem, and a few Jews, and all of them think
that it is applicable to them.  Of course, I can't say that these people
(just some that I know pretty well) are accurate representations of their
faiths.

So, are you saying that they redesign the plates each year?

Anyway, your whole argument (conveniently deleted I see) was that the motto
somehow costs us all a lot of money.  This is just not correct.

That is to say, the religion of this country, and the non-religion of
the USSR.  That was what most of those quotes were about, and some included
all atheists, in general, as well.  I don't think that any of the quotes
(although I seem to have lost them) mentioned anything at all about Jesus.
They advocated religion over non-religion.  A specific religion was not
mentioned.

So, you are saying that all Christians must believe that all other religions
should be outlawed, just because they think they are wrong?  That's silly.
I think the Flat-Earthers are wrong, but I don't advocate their banishment.

I think that any such cost would be insignificant.  I mentioned the slight
cost because you said that the motto was costing us a lot of money by
being on our currency.

Well, mottos in general don't really have purposes...  I don't think it
should be removed because I think the benefit would be outweighed by the
consequences.

No, I think that it would be clearly inappropriate for a Supreme Court

If one reasons that the United States of America at one time represented

(and I do, in fact, think that this is true) and that totalitarianism << 
absolute government control and tyranny >> represents freedom's opposite 
(which it does), did the USA really win the cold war?

Funny thing, the InterNet: I have no idea what xv221 might be - except that it
might be something to do with X-windows on PCs (? If you know, and have used
it, and think that it is good, email me. [ryanph@mrl.dsto.gov.au]).

DV/X is a common abbreviation for QuarterDeck corporation's Desqview/X
software.

I have not used DV/X yet, but reading the blurbs that Quarterdeck sent me, it
sounds pretty great:
	* allows multiple DOS machines - the way that OS/2 does, but without
requiring 10 MB of RAM to get OS/2 going
	* pre-emptive multi-tasking
	* network computing - a proper X-windows client/server application -
this means that DOS program can be used on other X-windows computers on your
network, and that X-windows programs can be used on your DV/X computer
	* although it is NOT a version of Unix, it effectively has many of
Unix's features, and mostly you will be able to compile unix-type programs
using the djgpp or gnu c compilers

They advertise regularly in all of the major computing and programming
magazines. They also have InterNet support online (support@qdeck.com).

The number bounces between 2% and 18%, depending on the study quoted and
the type of gun being studied.

Some cites:

---------------------------------------

A recent BATF study (titled ""Protecting America, Yes"") surveyed 471 career 
criminals and found that only 7% of guns used in violent crimes were
purchased from retail dealers.

---------------------------------------

National Institute of Justice
Research in Brief

November 1986

                        The Armed Criminal in America
                              by James D. Wright

(1) Legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct
    sources of handguns for adult felony offenders.

Only about one-sixth of the gun-owning felons obtained their most
recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a
licensed firearms dealer.  The remainder -- five out of six --
obtained them via informal, off-the-record transactions involving
friends and associates, family members, and various black market
outlets.  The means of acquisition from these informal sources
included cash purchase, swaps and trades, borrowing and renting, and
often theft.  The criminal handgun market is overwhelmingly dominated
by informal transactions and theft as mechanisms of supply.

              WHY GUN WAITING PERIODS THREATEN PUBLIC SAFETY
                             By David B. Kopel

     The basic problem with waiting periods is shown by a Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms study of gun dealer sales in Des Moines and Greenville.
The study found that about one to two percent of sales were to dangerous
criminals.[51]  In short, waiting periods have no statistically noticeable
impact on any type of crime because only a tiny fraction of crime guns
are purchased at retail by ineligible buyers.

51. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Assistant Director of Criminal
Enforcement, Memorandum to Director, July 10, 1975 (Greenville survey; of
20,047 names submitted to FBI for record checks, 68 had felony convictions;
of those, 41 had not been represented by counsel at their conviction or who
committed crimes in the distant past; twenty-seven buyers were prosecuted)
(of the 1.3% of buyers selected for prosecution, .9% had non-violent felony
convictions, and .4% had violent convictions). Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, Assistant Director for Criminal Enforcement, memorandum to
Director, May 8, 1975 (of 374 records checked, 39 were purchasers with felony
records who were not appropriate for prosecution because of age or
non-violent nature of felony; six purchasers were prosecuted).

                            AT THE CONSTITUTION

                      By Eric Morgan and David Kopel

     Testimony before Congress revealed that most ""assault weapons"" in the
hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels.{97}  The testimony
is consistent with the National Institute of Justice's research findings
based on studies of felons in state prisons. The NU study, authored by
sociologists James D. Wright and Peter Rossi found that only sixteen percent
of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store. (The
figures included purchases by legal surrogates, rather than directly by the
criminal.) Wright and Rossi, who had begun their research as firm proponents
of gun control, concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases, and
probably not even full scale gun prohibition, would reduce criminal use of
guns. Wright and Rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime
directly target the black market in criminal guns, and
leave the legitimate retail market alone.{98}   Not surprisingly, Wright
believes that the consequences of current ""assault weapon"" legislation on
street violence are likely to be ineffective.{99}   He warns that gun
controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of
criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new
business.{100}

This is true for the mass market, but not for those who need strong crypto
and are willing to pay the price. After all, one can buy strong crypto today
if one is willing to spend enough.

Thus the concern is not economic.

The issue most worth worrying about is that after the system takes hold, the
government will outlaw other systems, and something voluntary will become
the only system available. That is a political, not an economic issue.

As a separate matter, you may be making an implied advocacy for cheap secure
crypto for everyone. It's true that the Clipper chip would probably prevent
that except via Clipper, but ""cheap, secure crypto for everyone"" is a
political discussion, not an economic one, and the whole point of Clipper is 
to resolve that political (policy) tension between securing legitimate
communications and tapping the crooks.

ARGHHHHHHHHHh

READ THE MEMOS!!!!

I said that I PERSONALLY had other people order the EXACT SAME FOOD at
TWO DIFFERENT TIMES from the SAME RESTAURANT and the people that
ordered the food for me did NOT TELL ME which time the MSG was in the
food and which time it was not in the food.

ONE TIME I HAD A REACTION

ONE TIME I DID NOT

THE REACTION CAME THE TIME THE MSG WAS IN THE FOOD

THAT WAS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

SAME RESTAURANT - SAME INGREDIENTS!!!

>Why, when someone eats something with lots of ingredients they don't

I eat lots of Chinese food - I LOVE Chinese food.  I've just learned
the following

IF I get food at one of the restaurants that DOES NOT USE MSG or

IF I prepare the food myself without MSG or 

IF I order the food from a restaurant that will hold the MSG (and I
never get soup unless it's from a restaurant that cooks without the
MSG)

I DO NOT GET A REACTION!!!!

OKAY

DO YOU UNDERSTAND!!!!

I GET A REACTION FROM MSG

I DO NOT GET A REACTION WHEN THERE IS NO MSG

If you're having trouble understand this, please tell me which of the
words you do not understand and I'll look them up in the dictionary
for you.

Why don't you pull your head out of your ass and into reality?  First off, what
is the deal with your subject lines? Do you think that you are being funny?
Ha ha.  What a developed sense of humor you have, I'm surprised they let you 
out of the cage.  Why don't we not talk about the ""official"" definition of
foreign aid and talk about where money is really spent.  More money is spent
stationing troops in Germany (ie paying the troops, maintaining bases and equip,
etc) than in Israel.  Plus, Israel does not ask the US to send troops to fight
her battles.  If you look at the amount of money spent defending Korean 
shipping lanes, Norway, and other trouble spots in the world, you will see that
aid to Israel - from a practical standpoint - is not that much.  And so what -
so what if Israel gets the most (assuming I buy your feeble argument)?  What 
is your point?  Do you not want to subsidize Israel?  Well, you have two options
1) Start your own campaign, get elected as president, and then force congress
to cut all aid to Israel or 2) get the fuck out!  If  you don't like how this 
country operates and can't change it then move to Iran or something.

I want to add link encryption to a module that multiplexes upper

acceptable, in other words, what are the pro's and con's of such a

I'd appreciate any help anyone could give me on these two questions:
 
The Brady Bill was in the news throughout 1992 but what actually happened to
it in Congress?  Did Bush veto it?  If so, when?
 
Also, the state of Virginia, I believe, just passed a gun control bill on
Febrauary 25 of this year.  I think it limits gun purchases to one a month -
is this correct?  What was the bill number?
 
Anyone?

No one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity.
Palestinians are no exception. Perhaps you heard about
anti-trust in the business world.

Since we are debating the legality of a commercial
transaction, we must use the laws governing the guidelines
and ethics of such transactions. Basic ANTI-TRUST law says
that, while you can purchase IBM stocks for the purpose of
investing, you can not acquire a large number of those
shares with the intent or controlling IBM. You can do so
only if you make your intentions CLEAR apriori . Clearly,
the Jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some
designs, they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate.
They were establishing a bridgehead for the European Jews.

The palastenians sold their properties to the Jews in the
old tradition of arab hospitality. Being a multi-ethnic /
multi-religious society, accepting the jews as neighbours
was no different, just another religion. Plus they paid fair
market value, etc... They did not know they were victims of
an international conspiracy. (I'm not a conspiracy theorist
myself, but this one is hard to dismiss).

Again Adam, the devil is in the details. I don't want to get
on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its
OK to return 100 deportes and leave the rest. Because 100 is
a nice number that you can devide by 10, 100 and besides, it
has an integer square root.

Do you actually believe this? My experience tells me that
every palestinian I knew still keeps the key to his home, in
Palestine. Besides they often refer to their exodus as an
escape from hell (so to speak). I know none that agrees with
you. Did you sample their opinions? I know you don't care,
just being rethorical.

Don't get me wrong. I beleive that Israel is democratic
within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group (Jews).
Israel probably had a few options after 1948: ethnic
cleansing Serbian style, and deserve the wrath of the
international community, or make the best out of a no win
condition: show the world how good Israel is towards the
'bad' arabs. Personaly, I've never heard anything about the
arab community in Isreal. Except that they're there.  So
yes, they're there. But as a community with history and
roots, its dead.

I stand corrected. I meant that the jewish culture was not
predominant in Palestine in recent history. I have no
problem with Jerusalem having a jewish character if it were
predominantly Jewish. So there. what to make of the rest

Probably within 50 years, it will be possible to disassemble and
re-assemble our bodies at the molecular level.  Not only will flawless
cosmetic surgery be possible, but flawless cosmetic PSYCHOSURGERY.

What will it be like to store all the prices of shelf-priced bar-coded
goods in your head, and catch all the errors they make in the store's
favor at SAFEWAY?  What will it be like to mentally edit and spell-
check your responses to the questions posed by a phone caller selling
VACATION TIME-SHARE OPTIONS?

Indeed, we are today a nation at risk!  The threat is not from bad genes,
but bad memes!  Memes are the basic units of culture, as opposed to genes
which are the units of genetics.

We stand on the brink of new meme-amplification technologies!  Harmful
memes which formerly were restricted in their destructive power will
run rampant over the countryside, laying waste to the real benefits that
future technology has to offer.

For example, Jeremy Rifkin has been busy trying to whip up emotions
against the new genetically engineered tomatoes under development at
CALGENE.  This guy is inventing harmful memes, a virtual memetic Typhoid
Mary.

We must expand the public-health laws to include quarantine of people
with harmful memes.  They should not be allowed to infect other people
with their memes against genetically-engineered food, electromagnetic
fields, and the Space Shuttle solid rocket boosters.

If you do a MEDLINE search on ""turmeric"" you'll see that it is a potent
lipoxygenase inhibitor which is being investigated in a number of areas.
I'm in cardiology and about 4 years ago the cardiothoracic surgery lab at my
hospital compared the effect of a teaspoon of dissolved turmeric vs. a $2000
bolus of tPA in preventing myocardial reperfusion injury in a perfused
Langendorff sheep heart. The turmeric was more effective :-)


A colleague of mine in the School of Pharmacy (Dr. Ron Kohen) has a paper ""in
press"" on the free radical scavenging activity and antioxidant activity of tea.

For better worse, the source on this on is Michael Barnsley. His article
in The Science of Fractal Images (Peitgen et al) is a fair-to-middling
intro. Barnsley's book Fractals Everywhere is a more thorough treatment.
The book covers Iterated Function Systems in general, and their application

   If the Papacy is infallible, and this is a matter of faith, then the 
   Pope cannot ""be wrong!""  If, on the other hand, this is not a matter 
   of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the
   Pope is the legal head of the church.

   In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice
   but to obey.

This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is
more or less heresy.  You might call it ""infallibilism"".  It's the
idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does.
This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.

The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and
well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can
make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.

A couple historical examples come to mind.

Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the
English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning
Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop
Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though
maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even
when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just
collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there.
This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop
Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!

Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages.
He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific
Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a
defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to
defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic
doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church.
He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In
the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he
recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the
Church.

If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such
subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you
will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall
into heresy or schism.

The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope
must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith.
A Pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the
Catholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no
legal *or* moral force.

>Ouch!  Thanks for trying it.

The following program is a very quick hack I created a few months
ago to determine whether a Sun Sparcstation IPC could perform
real-time, full-duplex encrypted audio with resulting data rates
sustainable by today's modems.

This test program reads linearly-encoded audio from the audio device,
compresses it with GSM 06.10 (compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples
recorded at 8kHz into 260 bits resulting in a 50 Hz frame rate), encrypts
it with DES, then reverses the process and sends the reconstructed audio
back to the audio device.  The compressed, encrypted audio stream
is 13 kbits/s (!).

My Sparcstation IPC (not exactly a very fast machine these days,
certainly slower than an ELC) would just barely sustain this activity
(audio underruns would occcur but the speech was very intelligible).  I
ran it as a real-time process to get the best results.  Remember,
though, that this program is a quick hack and the performance can
certainly be improved.

The audio compression routines can be ftp'd from tub.cs.tu-berlin.de,
I believe (look for gsm or toast).  I used Eric Young's DES
implementation but I no longer know where I got it from.

Hi!

	I have a question which is not directly related to X Screen Saver.

What X Screen Saver does is to blank the screen if it has been idle for
some time.  I don't want my screen to go blank but to get locked or call
xlock program.

	Is there a parallel call to XSetScreenSaver() which locks my screen
or call my lock program after certain amount of idle time?  Or is there a
way to find out how long the server has been idle?

Thanks

Well I am one of those (apparently) odd people who can sometimes
control their dreams.  For example, I might decide before going to
sleep that I want to repeat a favourite dream, or dream about a
specific place.  Or if I am having an unpleasant dream, I can often
(not always) redirect events to something more pleasant.

I guess I think that the same standards apply in these ""directed""
dreams as apply in waking fantasies or real life (ref Jesus teaching
about looking at a woman lustfully being the same a committing
adultary).

When my normal dreams display themes that I would not conciously chose
to dream about, I take that as a sign that all is not well with my
""inner life"" - maybe I have underlying tenstions/fears that need to be
resolved, or maybe its straightforward sin.  In either case, the cause
needs to be resolved.  

In fact, either case is pretty rare.  I don't
often remember dreams that I don't chose to have.  When I do, they
almost always tell me something important.
I also almost never dream in pictures, and especially not in colour
(in fact I've had precisely one full colour picture dream that I can
remember, and it was definately spiritually important)
I tend to dream in sound, with the odd blurred image, in black and
white.

Interesting topic - I'll be fascinated to read other responses.

   The serial number will be in a 64 bit block, with a 34 bit filler.  Doesn't
   take a lot to check to see if that is correct.

Depends on whether the filler is a constant (makes checking easy,
but susceptible to replay), or variable (e.g. timer, counter, random),
which makes replay harder and can also make it easier for the
inquisitors to know if they've missed messages, or gotten them out of
sequence, or other interesting things that sort of person might care about.

It is still easy to conceal super-encryption, at least until the
inquisitors get ahold of the K key, which can take a while,
presumably not in near-real-time.  (Worst-case, in which the escrow agencies
provide the U key to the local cops, still only gets one side of the
conversation per warrant, unless the same key is used for both directions,
which I suppose the CAPSTONE version of the chip will probably insist on.)

Well, actually, the Davidians (Koreshians?) started the fire themselves, 
the last I heard ( around 15:00 EST). Eight people ran out into the feilds
surrounding the compound. All were captured and two admitted to setting the 
fire. I don't buy your napalm theory at all (although it would have made a 
great commercial for my .sig). Why the hell would they have a wood stove
burning on such a warm day?  Flame throwers use liquid petroleum, napalm 
is more of a gel. Now to further dispute your theory, the diluted CS gas
was inserted around 06:00 if I understood correctly. The place didn't start
burning until around 10:00 or 11:00.

Calm down kid. Vernon (Koresh's real name) said himself that he would not leave
that compound alive. The inhabitants thereof had accepted the fact that they 
may very well have to kill themselves before it was all over.

There are at least eight survivors. A caller on Rush Limbaugh today suggested
that the rest may even be hiding in underground bunkers. That's not such a wild
idea considering their weaponry and resolve.

Sheesh! Get over it. I haven't heard (read) such ranting since the Hindenberg

finally stopped working to pay a bunch of guys to stand around and give press
conferences. Now they can get back to more important things, like catching

   Just because the 68070 can run upto 15Mhz doesn't mean the CD-I
is running at that speed.  I said -> I understand it is a 68070 running
at something like 7Mhz.  I am not sure, but I think I read this a long

   Anyway, still with 15Mhz, you need sprites for a lot of tricks for

And I suppose I should just take your word for it. Did you ever
think that many people who use firearms to protect themselves

I already own a cool jacket. I ride a bicycle to work and park
it behind my desk. And if my woman decides to go with someone
else, I'd be disappointed but killing her new suitor will probably
not endear her to me any more than before. Frankly, I've never

Does this pinhead know something the rest of us don't?
I'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns.
The government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail since
they don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-
burdened anyway. Where are they going to put all the millions of
gun-owners who won't fork over their weapons? Maybe you'd like to

Subject: Belcher terrific; Tomlin not; Reds win 5-0: RedReport 4-20
Nntp-Posting-Host: silver.ucs.indiana.edu
Organization: Indiana University
Lines: 154

Tim Belcher pitched a dandy three-hit shut-out tonight as Cincinnati won 
their second straight 5-0.  Pittsburgh Lefty Randy Tomlin was hit early and 
often by the heavily right-unbalanced Reds line-up, which managed some
recently rare power with their bats.

Belcher (1-1) was solid throughout and in fact seemed to get stronger as the
game progressed.  Early on he had several three-ball counts, but even those
were few and far between later on as he allowed only one base-on-balls while
striking out nine.  In a post game interview he said his change-up was working
for him--I should say so:  all nine of his strikeouts were apparently on 
breaking balls.

Tomlin (0-1), on the other hand was in trouble early, giving up a second-pitch
double to lead-off batter Bip Roberts.  Bobby Kelly followed with a single and 
Barry Larkin scored Roberts with a sharp single to right.  The big guys
(Mitchell, Sabo, Milligan) were unable to get anything after that--in fact
they all struck out--but Kelly managed a score anyway due to a double-steal
and a Tomlin wild pitch.

In fact, it appeared that Tomlin was going to recover nicely from his shaky
start-- he retired 9 of the next 11 batters to get to the fourth behind only
2-0.  Randy Milligan, though, had different ideas as his line-shot was
poorly played by Orlando Merced and turned into a triple.  Milligan would 
later score on Reggie Sanders' sacrifice fly, giving Cinci the 3-0 lead 
after 4.

The fifth inning spelled loss for Tomlin when Roberts led off with his second
double of the game, and one batter later Larkin smacked a double down the 
left field line, chasing Tomlin.  Barry later would score the final run on
Tom Prince's two-base passed ball.  

The Pirates managed their only threat of the day in the bottom half of the
fifth when Merced and Kevin Young hit back-to-back singles (the second 
being of the ""bunt"" variety), but Carlos Garcia struck out, Prince fit a 
foul fly, and pinch-hitter Lonnie Smith ""K'd"" to end any Pittsburgh hope.

Pittsburgh pitchers backed Tomlin up well, though:  relievers Blas Minor,
Moeller (sp?), and Nagel gave up only two hits in their four-plus innings
work.

Barry Larkin left the game in the seventh when the grounder he (mis)played 
bruised his right thumb.  He was taken to the hospital for ""precautionary
X-rays"".  Let's hope he's OK.

Cincinnati is now 4-9, still the worst record in the majors, but with the
two wins they may be looking at  moving out of the cellar!
Pittsburgh is now 7-6.

Why is that terrible ? That's exactly the way our code has been doing

I don't think Primeau is necessarily a bad pick...I'm was just trying
to locate the beginning of Murray's decisions...he slowness in trading
Carson has delayed Primeau's development...and you have to wait longer
for big players often...and Primeau can be a very good player without
being a point-a-game-player, especially on a team that has Yzerman and
Fedorov...if Primeau becomes Joel Otto, and gets 20 goals a season,
and plays mean...it will have been an extremely good pick.

But Allen, if you can assume the existence of an SSTO there is no need
to have the contest in the first place.  I would think that what we
want to get out of the contest is the development of some of these
'cheaper' ways of doing things; if they already exist, why flush $1G

And/or taking the rubber ball out of the mouse (should be directions
in the manual or on the bottom of the mouse) and cleaning it with
alcohol (isopropyl, I believe - the same alcohol as used for cleaning
your cassette deck).  This is good to do every so often, even if you
have a mouse pad.  Dust still gets caught in the mouse and on the
rubber ball.  As well, lint and other garbage may find it's way onto
the rubber ball and get into the mouse damaging the horizontal and
vertical sensors.

Hope this helps.  Good luck.

bleagh! this was a terrific trade.  snow will certainly be better than

i'm not sure about this one.  i think that it's good, in that a
pre-1992 boggs kicks hayes/meulens/whoevers' ass, and that a 1992
boggs still isn't ALL that shabby.  it's bad, though, that the
yankees expect a pre-1992 boggs, and will probably get a 1992 boggs.
however, i'd still play boggs over hayes or bam bam.

you have my full agreement here.  he's not all that much better than
velarde, and silvestri is just about a lock to be better than him.
however, i do enjoy the fact that ""spike"" is not a nickname.
not that this helps the yankees.

Subject: Hits Stolen -- Centerfield 1992
Summary: DCON and DOPS for leftfielders
Keywords: defense center
Organization: University of Illinois, Dept. of Comp. Sci., Urbana, IL
Lines: 118

Disclaimer -- This is for fun.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not
make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the centerfielders. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Juan
Gonzalez would not have made.""

OK, I realize that's unfair.  Juan's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin's 55.4% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by?

To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Extra 
Bases (doubles and triples let by).

Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't
take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article.

The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

More discussion --

DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)
Why such a bizzare formula?  Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that ""a run prevented is as important as a run scored"".
The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

Yes they did and thye said so - they said they went their with the

Sound van bogged down in a ditch. No warning given.

Yes it was and no it was not. It was a massacre - the murder of hundreds
of unarmed civilians who had no part in the fighting. The surviving men
were taken to the local quarry and shot in the back of the head. Not
intentional? Yeah right.

>The village housed Arab snipers and Arab troops.

No it did not - you have a source for this slander of course?

>Thus it was attacked for its military significance. It was not
>attacked with intentions of killing any civilians.

The men involved said clearly that the intention was to kill all the
men. It was a premeditated mass murder nothing else.

>To even compare Dir Yassin, in which some 120 or so Arabs died, to the
>Holocaust is absurd.

On that we agree at least.

>The Irgun did not want to kill any civilians. The
>village had almost 1000 inhabitants, most of whom survived.

Yes they did want to kill the inhabitants and many of them were killed.
This is of course simple to resolve, the Haganah sent a soldier to report
on the massacre. He brought a photographer with him. He sent in a report.
The Israeli government suppressed it. Now the government was a Labour
Government. Since then the Revisionists have gotten into power but for
some reason Likud didn't release the report and its pictures either.
Perhaps you might want to tell me why? If it happened as you claim then
there will be no pictures of men shot in the head with their hands tied
behind their backs, no women and children shot as they slept. Yet for
some reason they did not take the chance to clear their own name. You
have a reason for this don't you? I somehow doubt it. The facts are
exactly as the people responsible claim - a premeditated mass murder
nothing else. No Iraqi soldiers, no other fighting. Just ethnic cleansing
at work.

I have a hard time understanding this attitude.

If the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little
doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality.

As a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people
in your audience were headed there?  To warn them!  It would, however, 
be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists 
and then remain quiet about it.  

The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be
justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke
about it anyway, just to scare people. Unless you would accuse Jesus
of this, I would encourage you to reconsider what a loving response 
is when you perceive someone to be in danger.

Hello,

  I am considering buying the Hummingbird X-Windows software for a MS-Windows

	Again, not true. The characters in a TT or Type 1 font depend on the 
	maker. If someone converts a Type 1 font to TT they'll only get the
	characters in the font of orgin. TT allows for much more flexibility
	in this area as well. You can have thousands of glyphs in a TT font
	file (Mac/PS/Windows/Unicode char set) and use the characters
	appropriate for the particular platform you are running the font on.

Well, yes, both Type 1 and TrueType fonts can contain lots of characters.
And in both cases plain text fonts will be reencoded to Windows ANSI
in Windows, and to Mac standard roman encoding on the Mac. 
No difference there between T1 and TT!   

And as for fonts with thousands of glyphs, right know these are a liabiliaty
rather than a great new thing.  Reason is that a font with 3000 characters
is very large, and if you can only access 224 of them you are paying a heavy
price in downloading time and printer storage.  (And at the moment there
is only one program of that uses `partial font downloading')

	For instance, all or our fontpack 2 TT fonts have the Mac/Windows
	char set in them. The metrics of the fonts are such that if the font
	is brought over to the mac the user will have access to the full mac
	char set. 	

Yes and T1 text fonts all have the `ISO Adobe' character set, which is
a superset of Windows ANSI and Macintosh standard roman enocding.

The question is whether you can get at the glyphs.  In Windows, for example,
you cannot get at the ligatures `fi' anfd `fl' (both T1 and TT)even though a
font may very well have them.

ANd, while it is somewhat painful to reencode a Type 1 font and to create a
new Windows metric file (PFM) for it, there are utilities out there to allow
you do this.  How do I reencode a TrueType font?  How can I get at the
`fi' and `fl' ligatures in Windows (or on the Mac)?  Are there utilities
that make it possible to circumvent the hard-wired Windows ANSI encoding?

I don't wish to rehash the PGP patent issue at all, but I do feel
that some potential misconceptions in interpretting intellectual property
laws need to be raised.

You are correct that executing PGP would be a violation (unless the patent
were declared invalid by the courts), but...  there is a question as
to when, how, or if distributing PGP would be a violation.  If the person
or company distributing PGP receives money for doing so, then it is
clearly a sale (for example, if it were on Compuserve, they charge you
for access so they would be selling PGP).  When there is no charge for
PGP things get less clear, but there would still be a reasonable view
that it is inducing an infringement.

This is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid
purpose for infringing a patent.  Although it is clear that in order to
create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing
a prior patent, one must perform research on an existing patent.  To
just say that you infringed a patent (assume we're not talking the RSA
patent) only for research purposes (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then never
develop any related invention (ie. only use it), would be a clear
infringement.

But the NSA will not be doing any wiretapping.  The actual wiretapping will,
presumably, be conducted by the FBI.  Of course, the capability for this was
provided by the NSA, but I think that they are still within the limitations
of their charter.

I realize this is a fine point, and some may differ, but this is my opinion.
Although I don't care for Clipper and won't support or use it, I don't see
the NSA as having overstepped their bounds.

Here is a letter I sent to David Skaggs, (Dem, CO).  Before anybody says
something, yes the letter is a bit ""sharp"" in tone.  I have been writting
reasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in return
in the HCI party line.  Since he already is NRA F rated, I don't think that
upsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree, but recent events
in Texas REALLY have me pissed.

-------------------
							April  20, 1993
Representative Skaggs,

Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your response
you stated that ""Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control
legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.
My question to you is, ""what grounds would you use to deny them access to 
firearms?""  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total
ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.
I say this because there are only two possible paths of ""gun control"" which you
could have been referencing.

Either:
1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this
case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of
this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the
""cult"" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability
to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these
guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by
themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your
Church to be a cult!

This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of ""thought crimes.""  You
and Pat Robertson should really get along.

2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the
""cult.""  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by
some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh
illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest
laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that
David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted 
him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished
Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple
hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.

I have heard claims that they were ""stockpiling weapons.""  Yet considering the
number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of
line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of
Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged ""stockpiling?""

Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that
has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for ""reasonable""
restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain
250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They
are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR
district I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I
have only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your ""reasonable""
gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you
representing Sarah Bradys'?

I'm a hockey fan from way back, and maintain an interest as best I can
here in the hockey hinterlands (Oklahoma).  I'm hoping I can get a
reading from some of you about the move of the North Stars to Dallas.

I've been under the impression that Minnesota was one of, or possibly,
THE hockey state in the U.S.  So why is the team moving to a city in
Texas?  Is it that the owner is a greedy, self-serving profiteer, or
were the Stars really not making a profit?  Or was the city or whoever
owned the arena doing some price gouging?

As much as I'd like to see the NHL only a 3 hour drive from me, I
can't help but feel for the people in Minnesota, unless they truly
didn't support the team.  

Opinions, please.

First off, I would consider the severity of the pain. I had stones
several years ago, and there's now way I could have made it without
heavy duty doses of morphine and demerol and a two week stay in the
hospital. I was told that there was nothing that I could take that would
dissolve them. If the stones are passible, the best thing she could do
is drink LOTS of water, and hope that they pass, but every time they
move a little, the pain will be excrutiating. I was told by my doctor
at that time that the pain was comparable to that of childbirth. (Yes,
by a male doctor, so I'm sure some of you women will disagree). I'd
really like to know the truth in this, so maybe some of you women who
have had a baby and a kidney stone could fill me in.

Humph.  Deleted there was my list of non-religious reasons one might
want a moment of silence for a dead classmate.

Maybe everyone doesn't want to be silent for teachers to give their
pompous non-religious speeches in assembly.  I know I didn't.  So?

Please provide documentation that opposing only things that are
actively religious (e.g. actual prayer, ""Amen"" after a moment of
silence, mandatory classes in religion) and not things that have
possible but uncertain religious implications (e.g. moments of
silence, having the Bible on the shelves during reading period) is not
a way to prevent a state religion.

Dear Comarade Brandt,

As you know, the Reichsfuehrer-SS has directed that
SS-Hauptsturmfuehrer Prof. Dr. Hirt be supplied with everything
needed for his research work. For certain anthropological
researches - I already reported to the Reichsfuehrer-SS on
them - 150 skeletons of prisoners, or rather Jews, are
required, which are to be supplied by the KL Auschwitz.


However, the good Doctor needed some more items to complete his
research:

(60 men and 30 women), all Jews, were killed by gassing. This took
place, as far as I can remember, in spring 1944. In this case the
corpses were sent to Professor Hirt of the department of Anatomy in
Strasbourg.

brings up the issue of how the escrow agent will be paid, and the fact
that the government had financial leverage if they don't cooperate.
It's an important issue, especially if one of the escrow agents
decides they'd rather stop offering the service. 
I assume that if the escrow agent isn't the government,
then the contract for providing escrow service would include some
termination clause like returning the keys.

>   The easiest way is a user fee for each clipper chip manufactured. 
>   This makes the funding separate from government.

But who's the user paying the fees here, and what's the service?  
If the user is the government, then the funding's not separate from the government.

If the user is the buyer, what's the service?  
Keeping the key for me?  No thanks - I don't need, and won't buy their service!
Not telling everybody my key?  Sounds like blackmail!

If the user is the manufacturer, does the user have a choice about buying?
The alternative is to just generate the key and not escrow it, which is fine -
I'd certainly pay more for this kind of key than an escrowed key!

Face it, the escrow provider is providing a service the users don't want.
The only people who want it are the government, not the users.
What you're really talking about is either the government paying for
the service, up front or per-year, either from general taxes,
or from a special direct tax on wiretap chips, or on an indirect tax
(forcing the manufacturer to pay the fee to the escrow agent.)

I hope the escrow people have no way of finding out your name from
your serial number, especially if the escrow is a government agency.

Here in New Jersey, we have lots of people willing to provide that
sort of services for user fees.  There are people willing to keep your
store from burning down for a small monthly fee, though sometimes people
refuse to pay and discover that the service really was effective.
If you go to a baseball game at Yankee Stadium, there are people who
will watch your car in the parking lot for a small user fee.
Something could scratch the paint, after all.
And what a shame if your Clipper key got out!

Hello,

We are looking for a graphics package (preferably complete
with source code) that will run on our UNIX operating system
(a Sequent running DYNIX 3.2).  This graphics package must 
support a wide variety of character based graphics devices 
(PC's running a terminal emulator, primarily).  
At this point, X11 graphics is not an option.

This graphics program should, if possible, support these
sorts of graphics operations (minimum requirements):

   1) Complicated axes (log, linear, etc.) with fairly
      precise axis labels (multi-line labels, etc.)
      Major and minor tickmarks on axes, etc.	
  
   2) It would be nice if some limited amount of color
      plotting were available, if the output device
      supported it.

We have a copy of gnuplot and are currently using it, but
gnuplot has some limitations.  We are looking for something
more robust than gnuplot.

At this point, I'm looking for information about packages that
might solve our problems.  If you have any information, please
contact me at the above email address.  If the product you know
about is a commercial software package, please send a phone number
or email address so that I can contact them about pricing, etc.

Please, PAY ATTENTION.
I, and others, were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS, NOT JUST
HANDGUN HOMICIDES.  In terms of how likely are you to be killed,
(regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a
higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the
UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun,
then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.  But, to belabor the point,
you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the
weapon is irrelevant.  The UK is more violent, period.

Subject: Raytracing Colours?
Keywords: raytracer colours realism vectors
Organization: Computer Science Department, University of Cape Town
Lines: 25

I have a question about recursive, backward raytracing.

When an incident ray (I) strikes an object at point P, first
the normal (N) is calculated. Light rays are calculated (L1 to Ln 
where n is the number of light sources) - these being the light
rays that do not intersect with anything. The reflected ray (R) and
the transmitted ray (T) is calculated from the formulae.

Calling the routine recursively on R and T will return the colours 
along the rays (R and T) as rCol and tCol. Each object has its own
colour oCol and each light source has liCol (1 <= i <= n).

The question is: 
  How do you combine rCol, tCol, oCol and all the liCol's to get
  the correct resulting colour to return along the I ray?

All colours are defined as strucures (records) having r, g, b components
between 0 and 1.

If anyone has done this before could you give me a few hints?

  Do whatever you want with this program, though it *would* be nice if my name

  NOTE:  If you like the program and decide to use it, *please* send me a short
  email message to that effect.  Be sure to mention the full name of your
  organization.  When our sponsors ask us 'what have you been doing', it would
  be most handy to be able to come up with a nice long list of organizations

  Also, if you find XV to be nifty, useful, generally 'cool', and of
  some value to you, your donation (not tax-deductable) would be greatly
  appreciated.  $10 (U.S.) is probably a fine amount to donate.
  Folks who donate $25 and up will receive a nice, bound copy of the XV Manual
  printed on a spiffo 600-dpi laser printer.  It'll look lovely mounted over
  your fireplace.

Which looks to me as a suggestion (see Julian's comment above).

The README for xv 3.00 reads (in part) as follows...

  XV is shareware for PERSONAL USE only.  You may use XV for your own
  amusement, and if you find it nifty, useful, generally cool, or of
  some value to you, your non-deductable donation would be greatly
  appreciated.  $25 is the suggested donation, though, of course,
  larger donations are quite welcome.  Folks who donate $25 or more
  can receive a printed, bound copy of the XV manual for no extra
  charge.  If you want one, just ask.  BE SURE TO SPECIFY THE VERSION
  OF XV THAT YOU ARE USING!

  Commercial, government, and institutional users MUST register their
  copies of XV, for the exceedingly REASONABLE price of just $25 per
  workstation/X terminal.  Site licenses are available for those who
  wish to run XV on a large number of machines.  Contact the author
  for more details.

The second paragraph to me says that universities MUST register and

     This is not really true.  Excluding last season, the Giants
has been a better 2nd half team.  In 1991, they had a hot August
to pull to within a few games of the Braves and Dodgers before
fading in September.
     The Giants may go back to earth, but not as fast as last
season for two reasons:
(1)   Barry Bonds
(2)   Roger Craig is no longer the manager.  Dusty can manage
      his pitching staffs much better than Craig.

Street Station proposal, and a location near Broad Street and Race Street,
I think.  I can't remember the exact details, but the stadium would be
build practically downtown.  There is a small lot that could be used,
according to the paper.  The 30th street plan has run into some trouble,
because Amtrak does not want to reroute some of its lines in order to
accomodate the stadium.  I don't have an opinion just yet, just letting
everyone know that there are really two options being discussed right now.
Neither of these plans will be put into effect very soon, however, because
nobody wants to pay for it :-)

Jeez, Ed, when you started talking about traction management policies I
thought you were making some weird reference to looking after railway
locomotives...

The official line here (though I do have my doubts about it) is that the
front brake is applied first, followed by the rear brake, the idea being
that you avoid locking up the rear after weight transfer takes place. In
practice I suspect most people do what you describe.

If you don't slide the tyre, you have no way of knowing whether you've
achieved maximum braking or not. I'm not suggesting that you should always
aim to brake as hard as you possibly can - but if you want to find the
limits of the machine, you have to go beyond them. 

In any case, for maximum braking, if (as I suggested) you aim to keep
both wheels just on the point of sliding, then you'll be doing
exactly as *you* suggest!!

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,
you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.
A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or
birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be
the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within
the capability of the amateur rocketry community.

It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction
of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.
Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed
here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year
on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of
an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000
for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure
there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,
or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.

Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.
(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use
of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied

Buck Showalter just can't win. 

Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks
lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score,
and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out.
So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.

Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks
lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, ""I don't want a repeat of that
near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work."" Steve Howe,
whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't
do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the
Royals win it, 6-5.

What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together,
Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the
deal? We finally have terrific starting pitching, so all of a sudden, our
bullpen turns to shit!

What's Buck gonna do? And what's George gonna do if this continues to happen?

the owners are whining about baseball not being popular among a
large enough portion of the population, and have suggested various
""remedies"", such as shortening the game or trying to convince us that
""smoke'embake'emdominatebysheerintimidation"" is an accurate description
of what is, essentially, a laid-back game.

forget those lame ideas.  here is my new and exciting two-point plan to
generate interest in baseball among the masses.

point one: sex.
point two: violence.

let's face it, sex and violence are the only things that sell in
america.  here's how we can implement them in the game:

sex: cheerleaders, cheerleaders, and more cheerleaders.  dancing on top
     of the dugouts.  bringing hot dogs to the umps during the seventh
     inning stretch.  running up and down the stands.  (the south bend
     white sox actually do this).

violence: baseball players are such utter wuss boys.  the pitcher beans
     the batter, and both benches empty in what is called a ""bench-clearing
     brawl"".  EVERYBODY JUST STANDS THERE AND LOOKS AT EACH OTHER. stand,
     stand, stand.  look, look, look.  ho, hum.  then, the bullpens
     come running in.  when they reach the ""fight"", they just stand
     there, too.

     anybody coming off the bench who does not throw at least one punch
     should be suspended and fined.  further, the bullpens should fight
     it out in the outfield, so as not to waste time and energy running
     to the infield.

football: sex, violence.
basketball: sex, violence.
hockey: violence.
baseball: ""da pastime of da nayshun!"" - yawn.

Three possible results after interview:
1) rejection outright
2) acceptance outright
3) the infamous 'wait list'... 

If you are on a 'wait list', your entrance into medical school
is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their
acceptance.  This can happen as late as day -1 of starting
classes.

You can always call the admissions office.  The secretaries
should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your
application.  Be calm, respectful, and friendly; secretaries
have more power than you might realize, and you never know-
could be the dean of admissions answering the phone.

> Also does anyone have some useful alternatives in case i dont get in, i

If you don't get in this year, sit down and re-evaluate
yourself: your motives, desires, and goals that are directing
you into medicine; your academic and extracurricular
accomplishments.  Make a decision about whether you *really*
want to be a medical doctor.  I had classmates who dropped out
in the first semester of med school because they found it was
not what they wanted to do; I have friends who applied four
years in a row before they were accepted.  Medicine as a
career is a choice you must make for yourself; DON'T be
pushed into it because of your parents/family/significant
other.  

If you still want to be a medical doctor, determine how you
can improve your application.  A letter of recommendation from
a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive
recommendation is far better than one from a 'big-shot' famous
professor who only vaguely remembers your face.  Also, don't
be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest
and positive recommendation; give them a chance to say 'no,
sorry' instead of the medical school saying 'no, sorry'.  I
have turned down writing recommendations for some students
because I did not know them well enough to make any meaningful
comments, and some because I honestly could not recommend them
at that point.  

Rewrite your personal statement; take it by an English
professor or some other friendly person with skill and
experience in writing and proof-reading and get their
criticism, both about what you are saying as well as how you
say it.

Review your academic accomplishments.  If your grades are poor
in some area, don't be afraid to spend some time in further
coursework.  Evidence of determined committment will help
here.  If you filled your pre-medicine curriculum with gut
courses, it usually shows.

Look at your extracurricular involvements.  Participating in
local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus;
substantial leadership roles in an organization help also.
Beware of 'resume padding'; such things are not difficult to
spot and weed out.

Overall, a clear conception of where you wish to head and why
you want to get there, combined with an honest self-appraisal
of skills and aptitude, will be the best path to take in
applying to any program, medical or what-have-you.

Good luck with the process -- as Tom Petty says, 'the waiting
is the hardest part', at least emotionally. :)

I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net.
My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism
or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside the point.
What does the Roman Catholic church say?  Excommunication can be
real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.

After all we Orthodox don't cinsider ourselves schismatic or

legend even 500 years ago when they accepted tens of thousands of 
Jews from Spain who were fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition. Again, 
many Jewish families escaping from Nazi Armenians and Hitler's Nazi 
Germany took refugee in Turkiye during the 1940's. Turkish people
have unselfishly given home, protection, and freedom to the Jews over 
the centuries, including to thousands and thousands of them during 
the Second World War. Get a life or a cup of Turkish coffee.

 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the

                TURKEY AND THE HOLOCAUST

An  interview  with  Stanford  J. Shaw  (History),  who  recently
completed  two books:  The Jews  of  the Ottoman  Empire and  the
Turkish Republic, and Turkey and  the Holocaust: Turkey's Role in
Rescuing  Turkish  and  European  Jewry  from  Nazi  Persecution,
1933-45. Shaw  chairs the undergraduate  interdepartmental degree
program in Near Eastern Studies and has organized the Program for
the Study of Ottoman and Turkish Jewry. He is affiliated with the
G. E. von Grunebaum Center for Near Eastern Studies.

Editor: How did  you come to write these two  books on Turkey and
European and Turkish Jews?

Shaw: Basically, I'm  an Ottoman historian, but  I'm also Jewish.
I've  spent twenty-five  years studying  Ottoman history,  and as
time went along, whenever I  found materials on the Ottoman Jews,
I collected  them. But  I never  did anything  with them  until a
couple of years  ago, when I suddenly realized that  1992 was the
500th  anniversary of  the  Jews being  expelled  from Spain  and
coming  to Turkey.  Then the  Sephardic Temple  down on  Wilshire
Avenue invited me  to give a series of three  lectures on Ottoman
Jewry.  These lectures  were  greatly appreciated,  and I  became
motivated to  undertake further research  to develop a  book, The
Jews of the  Ottoman Empire and the Turkish)  Republic. This book
is quite different from the  works of most Jewish historians, who
tend to look  at the Jews in any country  more from the viewpoint
of the Jews  and the Jewish community, and rely  mainly on Jewish
sources.  I  view my  subject  as  an  Ottoman historian,  and  I
approach the Jews of the Ottoman Empire largely from the point of
view of Ottoman  society, using largely Ottoman  sources. After I
finished  this book  and  sent it  to the  press,  I came  across
additional documents  relating to  Turkish Jews during  World War
II. In the completed book, I had said that Turkey had done a good
deal  to rescue  the Jews  during  World War  II, but  I did  not
actually have many details. Then I  found a batch of documents in
the Foreign Ministry archive relating to actions taken by Turkish
diplomats to  help the Jews  before and during the  Holocaust. It
was too late to add this new information to the book in press, so
I decided to  write a second book. I  conducted further research,
mainly in the archives of the  Foreign Ministry in Ankara and the
Turkish Embassy and Consulate in Paris. The result was the second
book, Turkey and  the Holocaust, which details  how Turkey helped
rescue Jews from the Nazis.

- How exactly did they do this?

The story takes  place over a number of years.  The book presents
the material in three parts, first of which deals with the period
before the Holocaust. When the Nazis  came to power in Germany in
1933,  they immediately  started  dismissing  Jews and  anti-Nazi
Germans from universities,  hospitals, scientific institutes, and
the like. Turkey at that moment was just beginning the process of
reforming its  universities, and it  saw in these Jews,  who were
being fired from their positions in Germany, a good source of new
talent to  help modernize the Turkish  universities. Within three
months  after the  Nazis  started dismissing  these Jews,  Turkey
arranged to take many of them in. They were brought to Turkey and
were   given   appointments   as  professors   in   the   Turkish
universities, as  heads of scientific institutes,  and as medical
personnel in hospitals. About 300  to 500 major Jewish professors
came to  Turkey in  the 1930s. Ernst  Reuter, a  German political
scientist,  spent the  war  years teaching  political science  in
Turkey. After  World War II,  he was  mayor of Berlin  during the
Berlin Airlift.  Fritz Neimark, a major  German Jewish economist,
came to Turkey and helped  establish a modern school of economics
in Istanbul.  A man named  Reichenbach, who was rescued  from the
Nazis by  Turkey and  spent the war  years in  Turkey, eventually
came to  UCLA, where he  became a professor of  philosophy. Other
German Jewish  emigres engaged in cultural  activities in Turkey.
One  such was  Karl  Ebert,  who had  been  a leading  theatrical
producer in Berlin until he was expelled by the Nazis. He went to
Turkey, where he  organized the Turkish National  Theater and the
Turkish National Opera  Company in Ankara, with the  help of Paul
Hindemuth. So  the first  section of the  book covers  this first
phase, when Jews were being  persecuted in Germany and rescued by
Turkey.  Oddly enough,  the  German emigres,  when  they were  in
Turkey, did not seem to think too badly of Germany. They regarded
themselves more  as Germans than Jews,  and they did not  join in
the anti-Nazi activities of the local Turkish Jewish community. I
even  found  letters  from  the Nazi  representatives  to  Turkey
praising these German Jewish refugees for their work in promoting
the idea  of German  culture. Even though  these people  had been
persecuted by the Nazis and rescued by the Turks, they shared the
Nazis' feelings of  Aryan racial superiority over  the Turks. The
second part of the book deals  with the Holocaust, which began in
1940 when the Nazis occupied France.  In Europe at that time, and
especially in France, there were  about 20,000 Turkish Jews. They
had migrated to Europe for various reasons from about the turn of
the century onward. Most of them had settled in Europe during the
Turkish war for  independence after World War I,  when Greece was
threatening to overrun Turkey. The Greeks had persecuted the Jews
throughout the nineteenth century, and the Jews feared what might
happen to them if the Greeks  took over in Turkey. Many Jews fled
to France during  the 1920s and 1930s. Many  also abandoned their
Turkish  citizenship and  became  French  citizens. Suddenly  the
Nazis invaded France in 1940 and started introducing all sorts of
anti-Jewish laws.  The Turkish  Jews soon found  that it  was not
worth very much to  be a French Jew, but that it  was worth a lot
to be a Turkish Jew.

- How so?

Turkey remained neutral through most of World War II. It retained
its embassies  and consulates in all  the Nazi-occupied countries
until it finally entered the war on the side of the Allies at the
end of 1944. During the war,  therefore, Turkey was in a position
to  defend its  citizens  against anti-Jewish  measures, and  the
actions that  Turkish diplomats took  form the second  chapter of
the  book. Turkish  diplomats  who were  stationed  in France  in
particular intervened to protect Jews of Turkish citizenship from
the Nazis. For those Turkish  Jews who had retained their Turkish
citizenship,  there  was  generally  no  problem.  If  they  were
arrested and sent to a  concentration camp, the Turkish diplomats
would  communicate with  the  commanders of  the  camp and  other
officials and say in effect:  ""These people are Turkish citizens.
You  can't do  this  to  them."" And  the  Turkish  Jews would  be
released.  If  their  businesses were  confiscated,  the  Turkish
diplomats would protest and the businesses would be restored.

The Nazis  in general  wanted to keep  the friendship  of Turkey.
They hoped to be able to use  Turkey as a gateway for an invasion
of the Middle  East, and they also wanted to  obtain chromium and
manganese from Turkey. In order  to keep Turkish friendship, they
usually accepted  these interventions on behalf  of Turkish Jews.
The Turkish  diplomats sometimes went to  the concentration camps
to secure the release of Turkish Jews. At times they even boarded
trains hauling  Turkish Jews  to Auschwitz for  extermination and
succeeded in getting them off the train. Most of the foreign Jews
were sent  to a concentration  camp at  a place called  Drancy in
Paris,  and that's  where  most of  the  intercession by  Turkish
consuls took place.

The greater problem came with  the Turkish Jews who had abandoned
their  Turkish citizenship  and had  become French  citizens. The
consuls couldn't declare that  these people were Turkish citizens
because  they were  not.  My book  includes  photographs of  Jews
lining  up in  front  of  the Turkish  consulate,  either to  get
passports to  return to Turkey or  to get a restoration  of their
Turkish  citizenship.   This  was   a  bureaucratic   matter,  so
processing the application would take  some time. In the meantime
it was a  real emergency, because the Nazis would  arrest Jews on
the streets for almost nothing.  The Nazis would even arrest them
if they  had radios  or telephones  in their  apartments, because
radios and  telephones were  forbidden to Jews.  To take  care of
these  former  Turkish Jews,  the  Turkish  diplomats invented  a
document called  gayri muntazem  vatandash, or  ""irregular fellow
citizen."" The  document said in  effect ""This person is  a former
Turkish  citizen  who has  applied  for  the restoration  of  his
Turkish citizenship.  In the meantime  we would appreciate  it if
you  would treat  him  as  if he  were  a  Turkish citizen.""  The
diplomats wrote  the document in  Turkish and put their  seals on
it. Since  the Nazis could  not read  Turkish, on the  whole they
accepted  these papers  as certificates  of citizenship.  By this
means, the  Turkish diplomats were  able to rescue many  Jews who
had relinquished their Turkish citizenship.

Actually the Nazis were of two minds about the Turkish defense of
Jews. On the one hand the  Nazi Foreign Ministry, which wanted to
retain the friendship of Turkey,  was in favor of accepting these
interventions. On the other hand, Himmler and Eichmann wanted all
Jews exterminated.  At times  Himmler and  Eichmann were  able to
prevail and some  of the Turkish Jews were sent  off to Auschwitz
before the Turkish consuls could do anything.

- Do you have statistics on how many Turkish Jews were rescued?

There were about  20,000 Turkish Jews in Europe  before world War
II,  about 10,000  of whom  were living  in France.  Most of  the
information in this section of  the book relates to the situation
in France. I have published  the letters that the Turkish consuls
sent to  the Nazi  officials and  the letters  that came  back in
reply. Generally the Nazis said  that if the Turkish consul would
present  documents  certifying   that  arrested  individuals  are
Turkish citizens,  and promise  to send them  out of  France, the
Nazis would release them from the concentration camp. The Turkish
consuls also organized  special trains to take  Turkish Jews from
Nazi-occupied  territory   back  to  Turkey.  These   trains  ran
regularly in 1943 and 1944. The Nazis gave the Turkish Jews visas
so they  could pass out  of Nazi  territory, but the  trains were
often  held  up by  the  Nazi-influenced  governments of  Eastern
Europe  -   Croatia,  Serbia,   and  Bulgaria  -   because  these
governments really didn't want the Jews to escape. As a result of
the Turkish consuls' efforts, about 3,000 to 4,000 of the Turkish
Jews  in  France were  saved.  Another  3,000  were sent  off  to
Auschwitz, where  most of them  died. The remaining  3,000 either
escaped  across the  border into  Spain or  fled to  the area  of
southern France occupied  by the Italians, who  treated Jews much
better than  the Nazis did.  At the  end of 1943,  however, Italy
fell out of the war, and that was the end for those Jews as well.
Incidentally, the Turkish diplomats  in Nazi-occupied Greece also
worked to rescue Jews in that country.

- The second part of your  book then deals with Turkish diplomats
acting to  rescue Jews of  Turkish citizenship or  Turkish origin
from Nazi persecution.

Yes,  and  there  is  an  aside   I  might  add  here:  In  their
interventions on  behalf of Turkish  Jews, the Turks  cited their
treaty with Germany which stated  that Turkish citizens in German
territory would be treated the same as German citizens in Turkey.
On  that basis  the Turks  maintained  that the  Nazis could  not
discriminate  against Turkish  citizens who  are Jews.  The Nazis
claimed  (and the  Vichy government  agreed) that  they were  not
discriminating  because  they  were treating  all  Jews  equally.
Turkey  protested,   saying,  ""You  are  dividing   our  citizens
according to religion, but the Turkish constitution requires that
all  citizens   be  treated  equally,  regardless   of  religion.
Therefore, you cannot single  out Turkish Jews."" American consuls
in  Paris,  by contrast,  accepted  the  Nazi argument  and  told
American Jews  who were being  persecuted by the Nazis  that they
couldn't do  anything about  it, because  the American  Jews were
being treated the same as other  Jews. The third part of the book
takes place in Turkey, which  was the principal center during the
Holocaust for activities aimed at  the rescue of Eastern European
Jews. The  kwish Agency, an  organization established by  Jews in
Palestine to help resettle Jews to Palestine, set up an office in
Istanbul  in 1940  under the  leadership of  Chaim Barlas.  Other
Jewish organizations in Palestine, especially the kibbutzes, also
sent representatives  to Istanbul  to set up  headquarters. These
groups first tried to contact Jews  in Eastern Europe to find out
what was  happening. Today  we know about  the Holocaust,  but at
that  time people  didn't know  what  was going  on. They  didn't
imagine the Nazis could do the things they were doing. And so the
first step was to get information, and the Turkish government let
them use the Turkish mails to send letters to their relatives and
friends  in Eastern  Europe. The  Jewish organizations  found out
what was happening when they  received replies. Later on when the
Nazis  began  to  intercept   such  letters,  the  Jews  received
assistance  also from  the  Vatican nuncio,  Angelo Roncali,  who
served as  the Vatican  representative in  Istanbul from  1935 to
1944  and   later  became  Pope   John  XXIII.  As   the  Vatican
representative  during the  war, he  used the  facilities of  the
Catholic  Church to  supplement what  the Turkish  government was
doing to  assist Jewish  agencies in  contacting Jews  in Eastern
Europe.  With the  cooperation of  the Turkish  government, these
agencies  then  sent  hard  currency, food,  clothing,  and  even
railroad  and  steamship  tickets   to  Jews  in  Czechoslovakia,
Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary. They weren't able to help much in
Poland because  by then the  Nazis had  wiped out almost  all the
Polish Jews.  Whenever possible the rescue  agencies arranged for
the Jews to get out of Eastern Europe either by train through the
so called  Orient Express route  to Istanbul, or by  boat through
the Black Sea to Istanbul.

Turkey was not eager for all  these refugees to remain within its
borders during  the war, because  it was being blockaded  and was
suffering   terrible  shortages   of  food   and  clothing.   The
government,   therefore,   facilitated   the  movement   of   the
non-Turkish Jewish  refugees from Turkey to  Palestine, either by
the Taurus  Express Railroad through  the mountains to  Syria and
Palestine,  or by  small boats  across the  eastern Mediterranean
from southern  Turkey to  Palestine. These efforts  were bitterly
opposed not only  by the Nazis, but also by  the British, who did
not want  any more Jewish  immigration to Palestine  because they
feared it would hurt their  relations with the Arabs. The British
constantly pressured the Turkish  government to stop this traffic
and send those Jews back. In  a few cases the Turkish government,
yielding  to  British pressure,  did  send  the boats  back.  For
example, in  one incident,  the steamship  Struma, with  some 700
Jewish  refugees  from Romania,  was  sent  back by  the  Turkish
government  as  a  result  of the  intervention  of  the  British
ambassador. When  that ship was  sunk by a Soviet  submarine, all
were lost except one person.  Nevertheless, all told, the Turkish
government allowed no fewer than 100,000 Eastern European Jews to
pass through  Turkish territory and  move on to  Palestine during
the Second World War. The Turkish authorities also provided these
refugees with facilities  and money, and gave  them permission to
send money and food out of the country.

- Many  of these  Jews who  passed  through Turkey  may still  be
living in Israel.

Yes, and  their children. But  let's return  for a moment  to the
first group, the Turkish Jews who  came from Europe. They did not
go  on  to   Palestine;  they  stayed  in  Turkey.   It  was  the
non-Turkish, Eastern  European Jews who passed  through Turkey en
route to Palestine. Their story is very interesting.

- And you have rescued it from obscurity.

Many studies have been made of the Holocaust, but most of them do
not focus on the Eastern European or Middle Eastern Jews. Most of
the scholarship  has centered  on the  Western European  Jews, of
whom 6 million were massacred by the Nazis. My study deals with a
much smaller  number of  people. I  have tried  to round  out the
picture,  and I  hope my  book  will persuade  other scholars  to
undertake further investigations in the history of Eastern Jews.

When it  comes to numbers,  the German Jews were  also relatively
small in number. Most of the millions slain were Polish Jews. The
rescue  of  100,000  Eastern  European   Jews  may  not  seem  so
significant  compared  with  the  total of  6  million  who  were
murdered, but it meant a lot to those who were saved.

About  three-fourths   of  the  book  consists   of  documents  -
translations  of many  documents. They  are included  because the
story is not well known. Not  only are people in the West unaware
of  the courageous  actions of  the Turkish  diplomats; even  the
people of Turkey  did not know the story. I  felt that they would
not  fully understand  this  remarkable  achievement unless  they
could see the documents.

- What languages are used in the documents?

Most of them are in Turkish  or French; some are in Hebrew. There
is a great  deal of material in Hebrew about  the organization of
the boats  going to Palestine, the  passengers, and so on,  but I
did not go into those details extensively. I describe mostly what
Turkey did, so  most of my documents are in  Turkish or French. A
few documents are  in English. The Jewish groups  in Istanbul did
not necessarily  cooperate with  one another  to rescue  Jews; in
fact, they often fought with  one another. They took turns trying
to  get  the  Turkish  government to  deport  rival  groups.  For
example, some of  the kibbutz groups felt that  the Jewish Agency
was  run by  Western European  Jews who  were interested  only in
helping  Western  European  Jews.  Finally,  in  1944,  President
Roosevelt sent a personal  representative, Ira Hirschman, who had
been an executive of Bloomingdale's  department store in New York
City, and  Hirschman managed to reconcile  their differences. The
documents related to his mission are in English.

I also obtained many documents  from Serge Klarsfeld, a Holocaust
historian in France,  who mainly worked on the  French Jews. (His
father was  killed by  the Nazis.)  He gave  me materials  he had
gathered in the German archives on  the Turkish Jews, so I didn't
personally consult the German archives.  I believe that much more
can  be learned  from the  German  archives, and  I hope  someone
someday will make the effort.

- This new book fits in well with your teaching, doesn't it?

Right. I'm  giving a  course on  the history of  the Jews  of the
Ottoman  Empire.  I first  gave  the  course  two years  ago.  In
addition to  research, writing, and teaching,  I've been actively
involved in  the commemoration  of the  500th anniversary  of the
coming of the  Jews to the Ottoman Empire. Among  other things, I
helped organize  a large international conference  on the subject
which was held in Istanbul in 1992.

- Now that your  books are finished and the  conference has taken
place, what do you plan to do next?

I'm working on two new books. One is a history of the Turkish War
for Independence, which took place  after World War I, during the
years  1918 to  1923. The  Turks warded  off the  efforts of  the
victorious  European   powers  to  occupy  Turkey   and  end  its
independence. The  second book is  a study of Sultan  Abdul Hamid
II, the last major sultan, who ruled from 1876 to 1909. He was an
important modernizer in his own  way, although he also suppressed
all sorts of political movements.

Stanford  J. Shaw  received  a B.A.  in History  and  an M.A.  in
British History. He then shifted to Near Eastern History, earning
a second M.A.  and a Ph.D. at Princeton. As  a doctoral candidate
at Princeton, he  spent two years abroad, studying  at the School
of  Oriental  and  African  Studies, University  of  London;  the
University of  Cairo, the American  University at Cairo,  and the
University of  Istanbul. He  taught at  Harvard before  coming to
UCLA in 1966. His postdoctoral research has been supported by the
John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, the American Research Institute
in  Turkey, the  Social  Science Research  Council, the  National
Endowment for the Humanities, the Fulbright Program, and ISOP. He
has  received  honorary  degrees   from  Harvard  University  and
Bosporus University, Bebek, Istanbul, Turkey, and medals of honor
for lifetime contributions  to the fields of  Islamic and Turkish
studies from the Center for Research in Islamic History, Art, and
Culture in  Istanbul and from  the American Friends of  Turkey in
Washington,  D.C. In  addition to  undertaking many  professional
service activities and public lectures  in both the United States
and Turkey,  Shaw has  also produced eight  books and  one edited
volume. His  History of  the Ottoman Empire  and Modem  Turkey (2
vols.)  has been  published  in many  editions  (six editions  or
reprints  from 1977-1991),  and  translated  into Turkish  (1983,
1991) and French (1984). His book  The Jews of the Ottoman Empire
and  the  Turkish  Republic  (MacMillan,  London,  and  New  York
University Press, 1992) will  be published in Turkish translation
by the Turkish  Historical Society, Istanbul. His  Turkey and the
Holocaust: Turkey's  Role in Rescuing Turkish  and European Jewry
from Nazi  Persecution, 1933-1945 will be  published by Macmillan
Publishers,  London, and  New York  University Press  in 1993.  A
pamphlet summarizing the book was published in Ankara, Turkey, in
1992.

There are some tricks to installing ATM to windows... install them first
to dos, then run the ATM control panel to get them into windows.

The best reason for ATM is that Adobe IS the standard.  Truetype is a
failed MS venture to undercut Adobe when Adobe was being nasty about
keeping their formats proprietary.  Just about any service bureau or print
shop will smirk and send you on your way if you bring a TrueType document
to them for high resolution printing or ripping.

Although there are lots of pretty TT fonts floating around, they are really
for dot matrix or your own lazer printer.
However, you can convert your TT fonts with Fontmonger or some similar program
to ATM fonts for high end stuff.

If you are using dot matrix for all your printing, you may have wasted
your money!

to the Palestinian people;

2. Expresses its appreciation to the States, United Nations bodies
and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that have
provided assistance to the Palestinian people,

3. Requests the international community, the United Nations system
and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to
sustain and increase their assistance to the Palestinian people,
in close cooperation with the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO), taking in account the economic losses of the Palestinian
people as a result of the Gulf crisis;

4. Calls for treatment on a transit basis of Palestinian exports
and imports passing through neighbouring ports and points of exit
and entry;

5. Also calls for the granting of trade concessions and concrete
preferential measures for Palestinian exports on the basis of
Palestinian certificates of origin;

6. Further calls for the immediate lifting of Israeli restrictions
and obstacles hindering the implementation of assistance projects
by the United Nations Development Programme, other United Nations
bodies and others providing economic and social assistance to the
Palestinian people in the occupied Palestinian territory;

7. Reiterates its call for the implementation of development
projects in the occupied Palestinian territory, including the
projects mentioned in its resolution 39/223 of 18 December 1984;

8. Calls for facilitation of the establishment of Palestinian
development banks in the occupied Palestinian territory, with a
view to promoting investment, production, employment and income
therein;

9. Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General
The General Assembly at its 47th session, through the Economic and Social
Council, on the progress made in the implementation of the present
resolution.

I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the
Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous
penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a
match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and
seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for ""delay of game""
for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3
skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans
were starting to come up strong.
I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.
If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not
able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to
admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most
other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the
Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish
spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see
all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best
team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team
looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to
admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team
to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).
But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as
these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)
Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all
ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a
great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience
most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as
a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we
just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers
corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all
Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging
around beeing drunk on ferries...). 
In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you
don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.

I agree with Shai,  there are many references to Israeli
plans on the Litani river but I have yet to find hard 
evidence.  I had mentioned before that there is a report
commissioned by the UN to study the Litani river, it is 
still in draft form.  The Israeli gov't also commissioned
a study on the river that was done by Dr. Ben Wolfe.
The Litani starts in the Bekaa valley in Lebanon,
flows Southward, then West across South Lebanon and
discharges into the Mediterranean near the city of Tyre.
There are other rivers such as the Hasbani and the Wazzani
that start in Lebanese territory than join the Jordan river.  
The most mentioned plan was one that would divert water
from the Litani into these, then the water would flow
naturally into the Lac De Houle.  BUT there is no evidence
of any diversion structure (which would need to be at least
3 km long).  The area is mountainous, inaccessible and
occupied by Israel so I have not seen any independent 
reports of the existence of any diversion structure there.
Another often mentioned diversion is through deep wells.
It is also rumored that Israe has 600 m wells
tapping into deep aquifers and drawing water on the
Israeli side of the border.  If such wells are indeed
under use they would be costly to operate 
(high energy costs) and the Lebanese and Israeli gov't should 
agree on the distribution of water from shared aquifers
as part of an overall peace plan and the bilateral
negociations on ""regional issues"".  The fact that we have
been at war all this time has led to the current state
of affairs where withdrawals from such aquifers is
completely unregulated.

I'll leave questions 1 and 2 to be answered elsewhere, but on question 3)
something in the noos today might be an example of the restoration might be.
Namely, that the Clinton Administration is considering asking the UN to 
establish a police force for Haiti.

I didn't hear any thing that said that the current Govt. of Haiti asked for it,
nor is there any real precedent (barring Somalia) for the UN getting involved
in internal conflicts.

That might also answer question 2). The neo-colonial countries are a diffuse
lot - the UN (Security Council).

And while I am at it, I'll take a stab at 1) - the new colonialism, as defined in
most articles I have read, would entail something of the nature of Trusteeship
under the UN Sec. Council, democracy, aid, education, free-markets, free press
and then out for the colonialists, now assured that there is a ""civilized"" 
country that they have left behind.

Note I don't support this idealized concept, simply because I think it is a
lot of hogwash.

If they're planning on patenting an algorithm, then I hope they go out of

I have been having problems with a slightly different clutch problem on
my 90 Prelude. See rec.autos.tech for more detail. My problem is a false
engagement point below the actual one. It also seems affected by weather -
it is most noticeable (and annoying) on damp or cold days. My dealer says
he can't reproduce the problem - I think I'll just sell the car.

Maybe you need to go into \mach32\install and set a refresh rate for

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).

Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young
and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.

Reply-To: sera@zuma.UUCP (Serdar Argic)
Distribution: world
Lines: 72

The scenario and genocide staged by the Armenians 78 years ago in 
x-Soviet Armenia is being reenacted again - this time in Azerbaijan. 

The stories of survivors of Karabag massacre are in 'Milliyet' today.

69 year old Hatin Nine telling:

-''My Twin grandchildren were cut to pieces in front of my eyes. They told
me: We won't kill you. But the babies have to die in front of your eyes.''

72 year old Huseyin Ibrahimoglu:

- ''Our Turkish village in Khojalu Town was blown up in two hours.
  While killing children and babies mercilessly they said: You are
  Turks, you must die.''

28 year old Gulsum Huseyin:

- ''They bayonetted my 3 year old daughter in her stomach in front of
    my eyes.''

Are these stories lies? Have the eye-witnesses been day-dreaming?
Were these stories forged by Turkish journalists in the region?

The nonsense of such a claim is clear from the writings of British
Journalists, too. Two days before we had quoted from a Sunday Times
article. They[British] reported the events in Karabag even before
Turkish journalists. What is more here are the pictures. Pictures
of people who were bayonetted, whose eyes were gouged, ears cut off.

Even the Armenian Radio couldn't claim these ""lies."" They are saying
""exaggeration."" That means ''somethings'' have happened but the
situation is not as bad as reported. Perhaps that village of Khojalu
town was destroyed in 4 hours, instead of 2... Or Gulsum Huseyin's
3 year old daughter was bayonetted in her chest instead of stomach...

The massacre is clearly seen with all its dimensions. The effects of
this massacre on Karabag and environs cannot be reduced by any word.

Some of the western press', led by some French Newspapers, ability
to ''close their eyes'' is nothing but complicity in this massacre.

Yesterday we gave samples from Le Figaro. Until yesterday's print
no news about the real events in Karabag were printed. So were the
French TV channels.. The subject they considered related to Karabag
was ''The necessity of protecting Armenians against Azeri attacks.''

The age we are living in is termed a human rights age. There are lots
of organizations such as United Nations and CSCE(Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe), and rules, all designed to fight against human
rights violations. International reactions must be made with international
cooperation. With support of everybody and every organization claiming
to be civilized.

Could there be a more serious human rights violation than that of the
right to live -and with such levels of barbarity and cruelty-? Where
is the cooperation? Where are the reactions? And the intellectuals,
journalists, writers, TV stations of certain western countries such
as France who are fast to claim leadership of ""human rights?""
Where are you?

That's an interesting statement.  There's quite a difference between
Hollywood's ""Old West"" and the real one.  Yes, there were drunks,
saloons, mining camps, and thugs.  However, as McGrath showed, the
thugs preyed almost exclusively on one another.  McGrath claims that
this was due to the fact that no one much cared if someone who
insisted on getting into a fight got his way, even if he lost, while
they really did care when thugs preyed on others.

We haven't figured out that those distinctions don't actually work.
Machine guns have been strictly regulated since 1934.  Said regulation
is both perfect (legally owned machine guns aren't ever used
criminally) and a complete waste of time (the criminal use of machine
guns hasn't change at all).  The result - we're now arguing about
guns that LOOK like machine guns, but are no different than other
guns.

We used to buy Beckman 110 and HD110 (""ruggedized"") versions for use
by electricians in the steel mill where I work.   After a while we
got round to filling all the current-input jacks with silicone -
electricians have a regrettable habit of not checking where the last
guy left the leads before using a 3 1/2 digit 0.5 % autoranging $400
meter to check if a fuse is good or not. Its very hard on meters
(and electricians) when you put the milliamp shunt across a 600 volt
bus. 
  But that's not why we stopped buying Beckmans - after a while a 
lot of them got ""funny"" in the LCD display.  A black stain would
spread from one edge, or else they'd come adrift from those
Zebra connectors and fail to operate.    Now we buy Flukes, the
low-end 20 series mostly ( and we still fill the amp jack with 
silicone). 
  What the world needs is a meter that won't let you change ranges or
turn it on/off with a lead stuck in the amps jack - a little bit of
clever plastic detailing would take care of this and make the world
safer for electricans, anyway.
   Not that I've ever put a meter on the wrong range into a live 
circuit, no, not me...not more than a dozen times, anyway....

I agree that the desire for beauty is valid, but I think your desire to
impose your vision of beauty is not.  You mention the age-old desire to
somehow get up there, but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment
of that vision.  You mention the beauty of a very dark sky, not impeded
by the effects of humans, but ignore the beauty of the as-dark-as-can-be
sky that is only visible from space, a vision that we, or at least,
our descendents, may one day be able to see, in part, because of efforts
that others call ugly.  One day, I hope, humans will be able to look out,
not upon half the heavens, with only nature-creted lights, but upon all
of the heavens, with no lights.  If advertising in space can help us reach
that goal, it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it, than the
'pristine' sky of yesteryear (or yester-century), which is totally
unreachable.  One of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern
sculpture was a human form, in the effort of striving to reach a goal.
I don't think there's any reason to believe that modernity has changed that,
just because it has changed the way we strive.

BTW, there are places that people haven't fouled.  Sometimes they make
it better.

Assuming you are presenting it accurately, I don't see how this argument
really leads to any firm conclusion.  The material in John (I'm not sure
exactly what is referred to here, but I'll take for granted the similarity
to the Matt./Luke ""Q"" material) IS different; hence, one could have almost
any relationship between the two, right up to John getting it straight from
Jesus' mouth.

The version of the ""usual theory"" I have heard has Matthew and Luke
independently relying on Mark and ""Q"".  One would think that if Luke relied
on Matthew, we wouldn't have the grating inconsistencies in the geneologies,
for one thing.

Because it closes up the gap between (supposed) writing and the existing
copy quit a bit.  The further away from the original, the more copies can be
written, and therefore survival becomes more probable.

>>And I don't think a ""one step removed"" source is that bad.  If Luke and Mark
>>and Matthew learned their stories directly from diciples, then I really
>>cannot believe in the sort of ""big transformation from Jesus to gospel"" that

>>And if John IS a diciple, then there's nothing more to be said.

>That John was a disciple is not generally accepted. The style and language
>together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.

I'm not really impressed with the ""theology"" argument.  But I'm really
pointing this out as an ""if"".  And as I pointed out earlier, one cannot make
these arguments about I Peter; I see no reason not to accept it as an
authentic letter.


>One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that
>to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.

The best analogy would be reporters talking to the participants, which is
not so bad.

>In other words, one does not know what the original of Mark did look like
>and arguments based on Mark are pretty weak.

But the statement of divinity is not in that section, and in any case, it's
agreed that the most important epistles predate Mark.

X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]

PhaNG, the Philadelphia Area NEXTSTEP User Group, will be holding a public  
sneak preview of NEXTSTEP for Intel Processors.

Where: David Rittenhouse Labs Room A1
       33rd And Walnut, southeast corner, Philadelphia PA
When:  Wednesday, May 5th
       7 pm to 9 pm
			 
			 
NEXTSTEP is the 32 bit UNIX based operating environment which has, until now,
only been available on Motorola-based NeXT computers. In the May 11th issue
of PC Magazine called NEXTSTEP a ""Hot Prospect"". Now, NeXT is nearing release
of a version of NEXTSTEP which will run on 486-based PC's, yet is identical to
the 68040 version. In fact, NEXTSTEP 3.1 includes the ability to easily 
compile a program into a single binary which will run on both Intel and
Motorola hardware.

NEXTSTEP 3.1 for Intel Processors will be demonstrated on an Epson Progression
486 computer. NEXTSTEP is scheduled for release on May 25 at NeXTWorld Expo
in San Francisco.

The demonstration will be open to the public. Come one come all! If you are  
interested in seeing the most advanced PC operating system around, come on by!

For a brief summary of what NEXTSTEP offers, see the May 11th issue of 
PC Magazine, page 66.

I missed the presentations given in the morning session (when Shea gave
his ""rambling and almost inaudible"" presentation), but I did attend
the afternoon session. The meeting was in a small conference room. The
speaker was wired with a mike, and there were microphones on the table for
the panel members to use. Peons (like me) sat in a foyer outside the
conference room, and watched the presentations on closed circuit TV. In
general, the sound system was fair to poor, and some of the other
speakers (like the committee member from the Italian Space Agency)
also were ""almost inaudible.""

Shea didn't ""lead the formal presentation,"" in the sense of running
or guiding the presentation. He didn't even attend the afternoon
session. Vest ran the show (President of MIT, the chair of the
advisory panel).

> 
>Shea's deputy, former astronaut Bryan O'Connor, will take over the effort.

Note that O'Connor has been running the day-to-day
operations of the of the redesign team since Shea got sick (which
was immediately after the panel was formed).

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste*
on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, 
but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military,
scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have 
the money, why not?"" approach.

It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible
that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that
Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred
years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding
levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you
put a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year? Even if you
use grad students?

Perry is right on target here. Careful analysis of the Clipper Chip
announcement reveals that is *not* likely to remain ""voluntary"" for
very long...the cost of the system, the cost of generating and _then
storing_ the escrow keys, and the admitted security holes pretty much
make the ClipperPhone a loser.

Strong crypto will outcompete it, if strong crypto is allowed. This is
the battle we face.

We had rumblings of this totalitarian key registration thing a while
back, and now the other shoe has dropped. The firestorm of commentary
and criticism this time around reveals the almost immediate revulsion
this Wiretap Chip (and automatic Caller ID and Callee ID, don't
forget!) generates in everyone, or almost everyone, who hears about
it.

This is a battle we can't afford to lose.

G'Day All,

I'm looking for a program to convert BMP images to GIF, TGA or even PPM.

I'd prefer a unix program, but Dos is fine also.

I've seen Alchemy (for DOS) and some windows image viewers which can save
an image in other formats, but what I'm after is a converter not a viewer...

Any help would be apprieciated!

Needed to encode the movements of a 16"" Cassegrain telescope.  The telescope
is in the observatory of the Univ. of Mass. at Boston.  The project is being
managed by Mr. George Tucker, a graduate student at UMB.  Please call him, or
email/call me, if you have one or two of the specified type of encoder.  Of
course, due to our low funding level we are looking for a price that is
sufficiently lower than that given for new encoders.  :)

I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  Given
about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available)
and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could 
synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population
of several major US cities.  As also noted, the knowledge is there for
the production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  The
only thing is the expense.  

Now I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of any
law; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Any
law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to 
add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In the
case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that
someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.  

Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US
and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as
GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and 
it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture
without anyone knowing about it.

An effort was made to remove the sticker.  It came to pieces, leaving
most of it firmly attached to the window.  It was dark, and around
10:00 pm.  The sticker (before being mangled in an ineffective attempt
to be torn off) warned the car would be towed if not removed.  A
""reasonable person"" would arguably have driven the car.  Had an
accident occured, I don't think my friend's attorney would have much
trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement.

As a practical matter, even without a conviction, the cost and
inconvenience of defending against the suit would be considerable.

As a moral matter, it was a pretty fucking stupid thing to do for so
paltry a violation as parking without an authorization sticker (BTW, it
wasn't ""somebody's"" spot, it was resident-only, but unassigned,
parking).

Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.
What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent
increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit 
(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.
Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps
growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each
president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.
Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.

As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....

During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an
""economist"" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his
arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know
with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government
policy, particularly ""supply side"" policy, since taxes do not ""cause"" 
economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be 
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and 
create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is.

	This is a very good point.  AT&T obviously knew and participated in the

It would seem that the one fact that the government has overlooked in this
whole fiasco is the economic standpoint.  As others have mentioned, the most
difficulty the Clipper chip faces is an economic one.  Let's face it, the
average consumer doesn't care or know that the Clipper is a bad idea.  If
there is a perceived need for cellular encryption, then the companies will
provide one.  Most likely, a standard will emerge.  But if the Clipper is
too expensive (and $25 a chip is way too much) then they will develope their
own or buy a cheaper one.  I give SCT my full support, and hope the
Clipper chip goes the way of the Beta video tape format.

Also hope they get sued over re-using the name Clipper.

Nope, Germany has extremely restrictive citizenship laws.  The 
ethnic Germans who have lived in Russia for over 100 years 
automatically become citizens if they move to Germany, but the
Turks who are now in their third generation in Germany can't.
It's not a very good example to show citizenship without descent.

Don't forget Robert Blake in ""Electra Glide in Blue"" (where else do
you get to see a full-dress Harley playing with dirt bikes?).
And if you're going to count Smokey and the Bandit, then you darn
well better include ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"".

Hello - I am in need of a file viewer for 24 bit TIFF images, to run under

I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
This is a ""physical layer"" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
I) physical identification scheme (number).

But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the
manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly
changable.  But it is strictly software.

The RS6000 compiler is so forgiving, I think that if you mixed COBOL & pascal
the C compiler still wouldn't complain. :-)

These buttons are in a row below the pulldown menus.  the pulldown menus

Anyone else experience this?

Trashy move from a trashy organization. After the front

Yes...I know he screwed up letting the King's grab Loach.

	- he played some US college hockey,

Just the kind of experience you need when trying to build

This continues a tradition of front office gaffs:

Well,  you better not get the shuttle as your launch vehicle.

and most ELV's have too  far of a backlog for political messages.

If during the campaign season,  the candidates for president had
launched one,  right around now we'd  be getting a launch
for PEROT 92.

and if they had used the shuttle,  we'd be seeing launches
for NIXON now more then ever.

Check with the local fire department.  My buddy is a firefighter and they
have these small map books which are Amazing!  They are compact, easy to
use (no folding).  They even have a cross reference section in which you
match your current cross streets with the cross streets you want to go to
and it details the quickest route.  They gave me an extra they had laying
around.  But then again I know all those people I'm not really sure if they
are supposed to give/sell them. (The police may also have something
similar).

I want to know the truth, and hold the Truth as the most
basic of all ethical values, because correct moral judgement
relies on knowing the truth, not vice versa. Moralities that
assert that assent to a belief is a moral choice, and not
compelled by evidence inevitably cut off the limb they sit upon.
Falsification of evidence, conscious and unconscious, follows
corrupting both the intellect and the heart.

______________________________________________________________
For Immediate Release                             April 23, 1993     

	     
                  PRESS CONFERENCE BY THE PRESIDENT
	     
	     
                            The East Room 


1:00 P.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Terry, do you have a question?
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, there's a growing feeling that the 
Western response to bloodshed in Bosnia has been woefully inadequate.  
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel asked you yesterday to do something, 
anything to stop the fighting.  Is the United States considering 
taking unilateral action such as air strikes against Serb artillery 
sites?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first let me say, as you know, for 
more than a week now we have been seriously reviewing our options for 
further action.  And I want to say, too, let's look at the last three 
months.  Since I became President I have worked with our allies and 
we have tried to move forward, first on the no-fly zone, on 
enforcement of it, on the humanitarian airdrops, on the war crimes 
investigation, on getting the Bosnian Muslims involved in the peace 
process.  We have made some progress.  And now we have a very much 
tougher sanctions resolution.  And Leon Fuerth, who is the National 
Security Advisor to the Vice President, is in Europe now working on 
implementing that.  That is going to make a big difference to Serbia.
	     
	     And we are reviewing other options.  I think we should 
act.  We should lead -- the United States should lead.  We have led 
for the last three months.  We have moved the coalition.  And to be 
fair, our allies in Europe have been willing to do their part.  And 
they have troops on the ground there.
	     
	     But I do not think we should act alone, unilaterally, 
nor do I think we will have to.  And in the next several days I think 
we will finalize the extensive review which has been going on and 
which has taken a lot of my time, as well as the time of the 
administration, as it should have, over the last 10 days or so.  I 
think we'll finish that in the near future and then we'll have a 
policy and we'll announce it and everybody can evaluate it.
	     
	     Q	  Can I follow up?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Do you see any parallel between the ethnic 
cleansing in Bosnia and the Holocaust?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think the Holocaust is on a whole 
different level.  I think it is without precedent or peer in human 
history.  On the other hand, ethnic cleansing is the kind of 
inhumanity that the Holocaust took to the nth degree.  The idea of 
moving people around and abusing them and often killing them solely 
because of their ethnicity is an abhorrent thing.  And it is 
especially troublesome in that area where people of different ethnic 
groups live side by side for so long together.  And I think you have 
to stand up against it.  I think it's wrong.
	     
	     We were talking today about all of the other troubles in 
that region.  I was happy to see the violence between the Croats and 
the Muslims in Bosnia subside this morning, and I think we're making 
progress on that front.  But what's going on with the Serbians and 
the ethnic cleansing is qualitatively different than the other 
conflicts, both within the former Yugoslavia and in other parts of 
the region.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, by any count, you have not had a 
good week in your presidency.  The tragedy in Waco, the defeat of 
your stimulus bill, the standoff in Bosnia.  What did you do wrong 
and what are you going to do differently?  How do you look at things?  
Are you reassessing?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't really believe that the 
situation in Bosnia -- it's not been a good week for the world, but I 
don't know that the administration could have made it different.
	     
	     On the stimulus package, I'd like to put it into the 
larger context and remind you that in this 100 days we have already 
fundamentally changed the direction of an American government.  We 
have abandoned trickle-down economics.  We've abandoned the policies 
that brought the debt of this country from $1 trillion to $4 trillion 
in only a decade.  
	     
	     The budget plan, which passed the Congress, which will 
reduce the deficit and increase investment, has led to a 20-year low 
in mortgage rates, dramatically lower interest rates.  There are 
probably people in this room who have refinanced their home mortgages 
in the last three months, or who have had access to cheaper credit.  
That's going to put tens of billion dollars coursing throughout this 
economy in ways that are very, very good for the country.  And so we 
are moving in the right direction economically.
	     
	     I regret that the stimulus did not pass, and I have 
begun to ask -- and will continue to ask not only people in the 
administration, but people in the Congress whether there is something 
I could have done differently to pass that.  Part of the reason it 
didn't pass was politics; part of it was a difference in ideas.  
There are really people still who believe that it's not needed.  I 
just disagree with that.  
	     
	     I think the recovery -- the economists say it's been 
underway for about two years, and we've still had 16 months of seven-
percent unemployment, and all the wealthy countries are having 
trouble creating jobs.  So I think there was an idea base -- an 
argument there, that while we're waiting for the lower interest rates 
and the deficit reduction and the investments of the next four years 
to take effect, this sort of supplemental appropriation should go 
forward.
	     
	     Now, I have to tell you, I did misgauge that because a 
majority of the Republican senators now sitting in the Senate voted 
for a similar stimulus when Ronald Reagan was President in 1983, and 
voted 28 times for regular supplemental appropriations like this.  I 
just misgauged it.  And I hope that I can learn something.  I've just 
been here 90 days.  And, you know, I was a Governor working with a 
contentious legislature for 12 years, and it took me a decade to get 
political reform there.  So it takes time  to change things.  But I 
basically feel very good about what's happened in the first 100 days 
with regard to the Congress.
	     
	     Q	  Waco --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, with regard to Waco I don't have 
much to add to what I've already said.  I think it is a -- I want the 
situation looked into.  I want us to bring in people who have any 
insights to bear on that.  I think it's very important that the whole 
thing be thoroughly gone over.  But I still maintain what I said from 
the beginning, that the offender there was David Koresh.  And I do 
not think the United States government is responsible for the fact 
that a bunch of fanatics decided to kill themselves.  And I'm sorry 
that they killed their children.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, to follow up partly on Helen on your 
stimulus package and on your political approach to Capitol Hill, Ross 
Perot said today that you're playing games with the American people 
in your tax policy.  He was strongly critical of your stimulus 
package.  He said he's going to launch an advertising campaign 
against the North American Free Trade Agreement.  How are you going 
to handle his political criticism?  Will it complicate your efforts 
on the Hill with your economic plan?  And do you plan to repackage 
some of the things that have been in your stimulus program and try to 
resubmit them to the Hill?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me answer that question first.  
We're going to revisit all of that over the next few days.  I'm going 
to be talking to members of Congress and to others to see what we can 
do about that.  With regard to the economic plan, I must say I found 
that rather amazing.  I don't want to get into an argument with Mr. 
Perot.  I'll be interested to hear what his specifics are, but I 
would -- go back and read his book and his plan.  There's a 
remarkable convergence except that we have more specific budget cuts, 
we raise taxes less on the middle class and more on the wealthy.  
But, otherwise, the plans are remarkably similar.  
	     
	     So I think it would be -- I'll be interested to see if 
maybe perhaps he's changed his position from his book last year and 
he has some new ideas to bring to bear.  I'll be glad to hear them.
	     
	     Q	  To follow up, sir, how do you plan to handle his 
political criticism?  He's launched a campaign against you.  Do you 
think you can sit back and just --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I will ask you to 
apply the same level of scrutiny to him as you do to me.  And if he's 
changed his position from the positions he took in the campaign last 
year, then we need to know why and what his ideas are.  Maybe he's 
got some constructive ideas.  
	     
	     I think the American people have shown that they're very 
impatient with people who don't want to produce results.  And the one 
thing I think that everybody has figured out about me in the last -- 
even if they don't agree with what I do -- is that I want to get 
something done.  I just came here to try to change things.  I want to 
do things.  And I want to do things that help people's lives.  So my 
judgment is that if he makes a suggestion that is good, that is 
constructive, that takes us beyond some idea I've proposed that will 
change people's lives for the better, fine.  But I think that that 
ought to be the test that we apply to everyone who weighs into this 
debate and not just to the President.

	     Q	  Mr. President, to go back to Bosnia for a minute.  
You continue to insist that this has to be multilateral action, a 
criteria that seems to have hamstrung us when it comes to many 
options thus far and makes it look as if this is a state of 
paralysis.  The United States is the last remaining superpower.  Why 
is it not appropriate in this situation for the United States to act 
unilaterally?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, the United States -- surely you 
would agree, that the United States, even as the last remaining 
superpower, has to act consistent with international law under some 
mandate of the United Nations.

	     Q	  But you have a mandate and --

	     THE PRESIDENT:  They do, and that is one of the things 
that we have under review.  I haven't ruled out any option for 
action.  I would remind all of you, I have not ruled out any option, 
except that we have not discussed and we are not considering the 
introduction of American forces into continuing hostilities there.  
We are not.  

	     So we are reviewing other options.  But I also would 
remind you that, to be fair, our allies have had -- the French, the 
British and the Canadians -- have had troops on the ground there.  
They have been justifiably worried about those.  But they have 
supported the airdrops, the toughening of the sanctions.  They 
welcomed the American delegation now in Europe, working on how to 
make these sanctions really work and really bite against Serbia.  And 
I can tell you that the other nations involved are also genuinely 
reassessing their position, and I would not rule out the fact that we 
can reach an agreement for a concerted action that goes beyond where 
we have been.  I don't have any criticism of the British, the French 
and others about that.
	     
	     Q	  Would that be military action?
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, several of the leading lights in 
your administration, ranging from your FBI Director to your U.N. 
Ambassador, to your Deputy Budget Director to your Health Services 
Secretary, have issued statements in the last couple of weeks which 
are absolutely contradictory to some of the positions you've taken in 
your administration.  Why is that?  Are you losing your political 
grip?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Give me an example. 
	     
	     Q	  Example?  Judge Sessions said that there was no 
child abuse in Waco.  Madeleine Albright has said in this morning's 
newspapers, at least, that she favors air strikes in Bosnia.  All of 
these are things you said that you didn't support.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  First of all, I don't know what -- we 
know that David Koresh had sex with children.  I think that is 
undisputed, is it not?  Is it not?  Does anybody dispute that?  Where 
I come from that qualifies as child abuse.  And we know that he had 
people teaching these kids how to kill themselves.  I think that 
qualifies as abuse.  And I'm not criticizing Judge Sessions because I 
don't know exactly what he said.
	     
	     In terms of Madeleine Albright, Madeleine Albright has 
made no public statement at all about air strikes.  There is a press 
report that she wrote me a confidential letter in which she expressed 
her -- or memo -- in which she expressed her views about the new 
direction we should take in response to my request to all the senior 
members of my administration to let me know what they thought we 
ought to do next.  And I have heard from her and from others about 
what they think we ought to do next.  And I'm not going to discuss 
the recommendations they made to me, but in the next few days when I 
make a decision about what to do, then I will announce what I'm going 
to do.  So I wouldn't say that either one of those examples qualifies 
speaking out of school.
	     
	     Q	  How about the Value Added Tax, Mr. President?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  What was that?
	     
	     Q	  The Value Added Tax -- Mrs. Rivlin and Miss Shalala 
both said that they thought that that was a good idea.
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't mind them saying they think it's 
a good idea.  There are all kinds of arguments for it on policy 
grounds.  That does not mean that we have decided to incorporate it 
in the health care debate.  No decision has been made on that.  And I 
have no objection to their expressing their views on that.  We've had 
a lot of people from business and labor come to us saying that they 
thought that tax would help make their particular industries more 
competitive in the global economy.  I took no -- that wasn't taking a 
line against an administration policy.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, a week ago a group of gay and 
lesbian representatives came out of a meeting with you and expressed 
in the most ringing terms, their confidence in your understanding of 
them and their political aspirations, and their belief that you would 
fulfill those aspirations.  Do you feel now that you will be able to 
meet their now enhanced expectations?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I don't know about that.  And I 
don't know what their -- it depends on what the expectations are.  
But I'll tell you this:  I believe that this country's policies 
should be heavily biased in favor of nondiscrimination.  I believe 
when you tell people they can't do certain things in this country 
that other people can do, there ought to be an overwhelming and 
compelling reason for it.  I believe we need the services of all of 
our people, and I have said that consistently.  And not as a 
political proposition.  The first time this issue came up was in 1991 
when I was in Boston.  I was just asked the question about it.
	     
	     And I might add -- it's interesting that I have been 
attacked -- obviously, those who disagree with me here are primarily 
coming from the political right in America.  When I was Governor, I 
was attacked from the other direction for sticking up for the rights 
of religious fundamentalists to run their child care centers and to 
practice home schooling under appropriate safeguards.  I just have 
always had an almost libertarian view that we should try to protect 
the rights of American individual citizens to live up to the fullest 
of their capacities, and I'm going to stick right with that.
	     
	     Q	  Are you concerned, sir, that you may have generated 
expectations on their end and criticism among others that has 
hamstrung your administration in the sense of far too great emphasis 
on this issue?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes, but I have not placed a great deal 
of emphasis on it.  It's gotten a lot of emphasis in other quarters 
and in the press.  I've just simply taken my position and tried to 
see it through.  And that's what I do.  It doesn't take a lot of my 
time as President to say what I believe in and what I intend to do, 
and that's what I'll continue to do.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, getting back to the situation in 
Bosnia -- and we understand you haven't made any final decisions on 
new options previously considered unacceptable.  But the two most 
commonly heard options would be lifting the arms embargo to enable 
the Bosnian Muslims to defend themselves and to initiate some limited 
air strikes, perhaps, to cut off supply lines.  Without telling us 
your decision -- presumably, you haven't made any final decisions on 
those two options -- what are the pros and cons that are going 
through your mind right now and will weigh heavily on your final 
decision?  
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I'm reluctant to get into this.  There 
are -- those are two of the options.  There are some other options 
that have been considered.  All have pluses and minuses; all have 
supporters and opponents within the administration and in the 
Congress, where, I would remind you, heavy consultations will be 
required to embark on any new policy.
	     
	     I do believe that on the air strike issue, the 
pronouncements that General Powell has made generally about military 
action, apply there.  If you take action, if the United States takes 
action, we must have a clearly-defined objective that can be met.  We 
must be able to understand it and its limitations must be clear.  The 
United States is not, should not, become involved as a partisan in a 
war.  
	     
	     With regard to the lifting of the arms embargo, the 
question obviously there is if you widen the capacity of people to 
fight will that help to get a settlement and bring about peace?  Will 
it lead to more bloodshed?  What kind of reaction can others have 
that would undermine the effectiveness of the policy?
	     
	     But I think both of them deserve some serious 
consideration, along with some other options we have.
	     
	     Q	  Do you think that these people who are trying to 
get us into war in Bosnia are really remembering that we haven't 
taken care of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the last war and 
we couldn't take care of our prisoners and get them all home from 
Vietnam?   And now many of them are coming up with bills for 
treatment of Agent Orange.  How can we afford to go to any more of 
these wars?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I think that's a good argument 
against the United States itself becoming involved as a belligerent 
in a war there.  But we are, after all, the world's only super power.  
We do have to lead the world  and there is a very serious problem of 
systematic ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia, which could 
have not only enormous further humanitarian consequences -- and 
goodness knows there have been many -- but also could have other 
practical consequences in other nearby regions where the same sorts 
of ethnic tensions exist.

	     Q	  Did you make any kind of agreement with Boris 
Yeltsin to hold off either on air strikes or any kind of aggressive 
action against the Serbs until after Sunday?  And in general, how has 
his political situation affected your deliberation on Bosnia?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I have not made any agreement, and 
he did not ask for that.  We never even discussed that, interestingly 
enough.  The Russians, I would remind you, in the middle of President 
Yeltsin's campaign, abstained from our attempt to get tougher 
sanctions through the United Nations in what I thought was the proper 
decision for them and one that the United States and, I'm sure, the 
rest of the free world very much appreciated. 

	     Q	  Do you wish, Mr. President, that you'd become more 
involved in the planning of the Waco operation?  And how would you 
handle that situation differently now?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I don't think as a practical matter that 
the President should become involved in the planning of those kinds 
of things at that detail.  One of the things that I'm sure will come 
out when we look into this is -- the questions will be asked and 
answered, did all of us who up the line of command ask the questions 
we should have asked and get the answers we should have gotten?  And 
I look forward to that.  But at the time, I have to say, as I did 
before, the first thing I did after the ATF agents were killed, once 
we knew that the FBI was going to go in, was to ask that the military 
be consulted because of the quasi, as least, military nature of the 
conflict given the resources that Koresh had in his compound and 
their obvious willingness to use them.  And then on the day before 
the action, I asked the questions of the Attorney General which I 
have reported to you previously, and which at the time I thought were 
sufficient.  I have -- as I said, I'm sure -- I leave it to others to 
make the suggestions about whether there are other questions I should 
have asked.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, what is your assessment of Director 
Sessions' role in the Waco affair?  And have you made a decision on 
his future?  And if you haven't, will you give him a personal hearing 
before you do decide?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, first of all, I have no assessment 
of his role since I had no direct contact with him.  And I mean no 
negative or positive inference.  I have no assessment there.  I stand 
by what I said before about my general high regard for the FBI.  And 
I'm waiting for a recommendation from the Attorney General about what 
to do with the direction of the FBI.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, since you said that one side in 
Bosnia conflict represents inhumanity that the Holocaust carried to 
the nth degree, why do you then tell us that the United States cannot 
take a partisan view in this war?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I said that the principle of 
ethnic cleansing is something we ought to stand up against.  That 
does not mean that the United States or the United Nations can enter 
a war, in effect, to redraw the lines, geographical lines of 
republics within what was Yugoslavia, or that that would ultimately 
be successful.
	     
	     I think what the United States has to do is to try to 
figure out whether there is some way consistent with forcing the 
people to resolve their own difficulties we can stand up to and stop 
ethnic cleansing.  And that is obviously the difficulty we are 
wrestling with.  This is clearly the most difficult foreign policy 
problem we face, and that all of our allies face.  And if it were 
easy, I suppose it would have been solved before.  We have tried to 
do more in the last 90 days than was previously done.  It has clearly 
not been enough to stop the Serbian aggression, and  we are now 
looking at what else we can do.
	     
	     Q	  Yesterday you specifically criticized the Roosevelt 
administration for not having bombed the railroads to the 
concentration camps and things that were near military targets.  
Aren't there steps like that that would not involve conflict --direct 
conflict or partisan belligerence that you might consider?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  There may be.  I would remind you that 
the circumstances were somewhat different.  We were then at war with 
Germany at the time and that's what made that whole incident so --
series of incidents -- so perplexing.  But we have -- as I say, we've 
got all of our options under review.
	     
	     Q	  The diplomatic initiative on Haiti is on the verge 
of collapse.  What can you do to salvage it short of a full-scale 
military operation?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, you may know something I don't.  
That's not what our people tell me.  I think Mr. Caputo and 
Ambassador Pezzullo have done together a good job.  The thing keeps 
going back and forth because of the people who are involved with the 
de facto government there.  It's obvious what their concerns are.  
They were the same concerns that led to the ouster of Aristide in the 
first place, and President Aristide, we feel, should be restored to 
power.  We're working toward that.  I get a report on that -- we 
discuss it at least three times a week, and I'm convinced that we're 
going to prevail there and be successful.  
	     
	     I do believe that there's every reason to think that 
there will have to be some sort of multilateral presence to try to 
guarantee the security and the freedom from violence of people on 
both sides of the ledger while we try to establish the conditions of 
ongoing civilized society.  But I believe we're going to prevail 
there.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, would you care to make your 
assessment of the first 100 days before we make one for you?  
(Laughter.)
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I'll say if -- I believe, first of 
all, we passed the budget resolution in record time.  That was the 
biggest issue.  That confirmed the direction of the administration 
and confirmed the commitments of the campaign that we could both 
bring the deficit down and increase investment, and that we could do 
it by specific spending cuts and by raising taxes, almost all of 
which come from the highest income people in this society --reversing 
a 12-year trend in which most of the tax burdens were borne by the 
middle class, whose incomes were going down when their taxes were 
going up, while the deficit went from $1 trillion to $4 trillion, the 
total national debt, and the deficit continued to go up.
	     
	     We have a 20-year low in interest rates from mortgages. 
We have lower interest rates across the board.  We have tens of 
billions of dollars flooding back into this economy as people 
refinance their debt.  
	     
	     We have established a new environmental policy, which is 
dramatically different.  The Secretary of Education has worked with 
me and with others and with the governors to establish a new approach 
in education that focuses on tough standards, as well as increasing 
opportunity.  We have done an enormous amount of work on political 
reform, on campaign finance and lobbying reform.  And I have imposed 
tough ethics requirements on my own administration's officials.  
These things are consistent with not only what I said I'd do in the 
campaign, but with turning the country around.  The Vice President is 
heading a task force which will literally change the way the federal 
government operates and make it much more responsive to the citizens 
of this country.  
	     
	     We are working on a whole range of other things.  The 
welfare reform initiative, to move people from welfare to work.  And, 
of course, a massive amount of work has been done on the health care 
issue, which is a huge economic and personal security problem for 
millions of Americans.  
	     
	     So I think it is amazing how much has been done.  More 
will be done.  We also passed the Family Leave bill.  A version of 
the motor voter bill -- that has not come out of conference back to 
me yet.  And everything has been passed except the stimulus program.  
So I think we're doing fine and we're moving in the right direction.  
I feel good about it.
	     
	     Q	  Sir, a follow-up.  Wouldn't you say, though, that 
one of your biggest initiatives, aid to Soviet Russia, is now 
practically finished -- if we can't pass a stimulus bill in our own 
country, how can we do it for them?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me recast the question a little bit.  
It's a good question -- (laughter) -- it's a good question, but to be 
fair we've got to recast it.  We have already -- the first round of 
aid to the Soviet -- to non-Soviet Russia, to a democratic Russia, is 
plainly going to go through, the first $1.6 billion.  The aid that we 
agreed with our partners in the G-7 to provide through the 
international financial institutions, which is a big dollar item, is 
plainly going to go through.  The question is, can we get any more 
aid for Russia that requires a new appropriation by the United States 
Congress?  And that is a question I think, Mary, that will be 
resolved in the weeks ahead, in part by what happens to the American 
workers and their jobs and their future.  I think the two things will 
be tied by many members of Congress.

	     Q	  The tailhook report came out this morning, 
documenting horrendous and nearly-criminal conduct on the part of the 
Navy.  How much did you discuss the incident and what might be done 
about it with your nominee to be the Secretary of the Navy?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  First, let me comment a little on that.  
The Inspector General's report details conduct which is wrong and 
which has no place in the armed services.  And I expect the report to 
be acted on in the appropriate way.  I also want to say to the 
American people and to all of you that the report should be taken for 
what it is, a very disturbing list of allegations which will have to 
be thoroughly examined.  It should not be taken as a general 
indictment of the United States Navy or of all the fine people who 
serve there.  It is very specific in its allegations, and it will be 
pursued.  

	     The only thing I said to the Secretary-Designate of the 
Navy and the only thing I should have said to him, I think, is that I 
expected him to take the report and to do his duty.  And I believe he 
will do that.

	     Q	  Mr. President, to back to Russia for just a minute.  
The latest poll show that Mr. Yeltsin will probably win his vote of 
confidence.  But there seems to be a real toss-up on whether or not 
voters are going to endorse his economic reforms.  

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I understand that.  

	     Q	  Can you live with a split -- (laughter) -- can you 
live with a split decision, though, or do you need both passed in 
order to then build support for Russian aid?

	     THE PRESIDENT:  I believe -- the answer to your question 
is, for the United States, the key question should be that which is 
posed to any democracy, which is who wins the election.  If he wins 
the election, if he is ratified by the Russian people to continue as 
their President, then I think we should do our best to work with him 
toward reform.
	     
	     You know, we had a lot of other countries here for the 
Holocaust Museum dedication -- their leaders were here.  Leaders from 
Eastern Europe, leaders from at least one republic of the former 
Soviet Union; all of them having terrible economic challenges as they 
convert from a communist command and control economy to a market 
economy in a world where there's economic slowdown everywhere.  And 
in a world in which there's economic slowdown and difficulty, all 
leaders will have trouble having their policies be popular in a poll 
because they haven't produced the results that the people so 
earnestly yearn for.  You can understand that.  
	     
	     But if they have confidence in the leadership, I think 
that's all we can ask.  And the United States will -- if the Russian 
people ratify him as their President and stick with him then the 
United States will continue to work with him.  I think he is a 
genuine democrat -- small d -- and genuinely committed to reform.  I 
think that we should support that.

	     Q	  Mr. President, Mr. Perot has come out strongly in 
what is perceived behind the line against a free trade agreement --
NAFTA.  How hard are you going to fight for this free trade agreement 
and when do you expect to see it accomplished?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I think we'll have the agreement ready 
in the fairly near future.  You know, our people are still working 
with the Mexican government and with the Canadians on the side 
agreements.  We're trying to work out what the environmental 
agreement will say, what the labor agreement will say, and then what 
the fairest way to deal with enforcement is.  
	     
	     The Mexicans say, and there is some merit to their 
position, that they're worried about transferring their sovereignty 
in enforcement to a multilateral commission.  Even in the United 
States, to be fair, we have some folks who are worried about that --
about giving that up.  On the other hand, if we're going to have an 
environmental agreement and a labor standards agreement that means 
something, then there has to be ultimately some consequences for 
violating them.  So what we're trying to do is to agree on an 
approach which would say that if there is a pattern of violations --
if you keep on violating it past a certain point -- maybe not an 
isolated incident, but a pattern of violation -- there is going to be 
some enforcement.  There must be consequences.  And we're working out 
the details of that.
	     
	     But I still feel quite good about it.  And this is just 
an area where I disagree with Mr. Perot and with others.  I think 
that we will win big if we have a fair agreement that integrates more 
closely the Mexican economy and the American economy and leads us 
from there to Chile to other market economies in Latin America, and 
gives us a bigger world in which to trade.  I think that's the only 
way a rich country can grow richer.  If you look at what Japan and 
other countries in the Pacific are doing to reach out in their own 
region, it's a pretty good lesson to us that we had better worry 
about how to build those bridges in our own area.  
	     
	     So this is an idea battle.  You know, you've got a lot 
of questions and I want to answer them all, but let me say not every 
one of these things can be distilled simply into politics -- you 
know, who's for this and who's for that, and if this person is for 
this, somebody else has got to be for that.  A lot of these things 
honestly involved real debates over ideas, over who's right and wrong 
about the world toward which we're moving.  And the answers are not 
self-evident.  And one of the reasons that I wanted to run for 
President is I wanted to sort of open the floodgates for debating 
these ideas so that we could try to change in the appropriate way.  
So I just have a difference of opinion.  I believe that the concept 
of NAFTA is sound, even though, as you know, I thought that the 
details needed to be improved.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, there was a tremendous flurry of 
interest earlier this month in the Russian document that purported to 
show that the Vietnamese had held back American prisoners.  General 
Vessey has now said publicly that while the document itself was 
authentic, he believes that it was incorrect.  Do you have a personal 
view at this point about that issue?  And more broadly, do you 
believe that, in fact, the Vietnamese did return all the American 
prisoners at the time of the Paris Peace Accord?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  First let me say, I saw General Vessey 
before he went to Vietnam and after he returned.  And I have a high 
regard for him and I appreciate his willingness to serve his country 
in this way.  As to whether the document had any basis in fact, let 
me say that the government of Vietnam was more forthcoming than it 
had been in the past and gave us some documents that would tend to 
undermine the validity of the Russian documents claim.
	     
	     I do not know whether that is right or wrong.  We are 
having it basically evaluated at this time, and when we complete the 
evaluation, we'll tell you.  And, of course, we want to tell the 
families of those who were missing in action or who were POWs.  I 
think that we'll be able to make some progress in eliminating some of 
the questions about the outstanding cases as a result of this last 
interchange, but I cannot say that I'm fully satisfied that we know 
all that we need to know.  There are still some cases that we don't 
know the answer to.  But I do believe we're making some progress.  I 
was encouraged by the last trip.
	     
	     Q	  I'd like to follow up on that.  Before the U.S. 
normalizes relations, allows trade to go forward, do you have to be 
personally sure that every case has been resolved or would you be 
willing to go forward on the basis that while it may take years to 
resolve these cases, the Vietnamese have made sufficient offerings to 
us to confirm good faith?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  A lot of experts say you can never 
resolve every case, every one, that we couldn't resolve all the cases 
for them and that there are still some cases that have not been 
factually resolved, going back to the Second World War.  But what I 
would have to be convinced of is that we had gone a long way toward 
resolving every case that could be resolved at this moment in time, 
and that there was a complete, open and unrestricted commitment to 
continue to do everything that could be done always to keep resolving 
those cases.  And we're not there yet.  
	     
	     Again, I have to be guided a little bit by people who 
know a lot about this.  And I confess to being much more heavily 
influenced by the families of the people whose lives were lost there, 
or whose lives remain in question than by the commercial interest and 
the other things which seem so compelling in this moment.  I just am 
very influenced by how the families feel.
	     
	     Q	     your economic stimulus package, are you doing 
some kind of reality check now and scaling back some of your plans, 
your legislative plans for the coming year, including the crime bill, 
the health care initiative and other things?  Are there any plans to 
do that?  And also, did you underestimate the power of Senator Bob 
Dole?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No, what I underestimated was the extent 
to which what I thought was a fairly self-evident case, particularly 
after we stayed below the spending caps approved by this Congress, 
including the Republicans who were in this Congress last year -- when 
we had already passed a budget resolution which called for over $500 
billion in deficit reduction.  When they had voted repeatedly for 
supplemental appropriations to help foreign governments, I thought at 
least four of them would vote to break cloture, and I underestimated 
that.  I did not have an adequate strategy of dealing with that.  
	     
	     I also thought that if I made a good-faith effort to 
negotiate and to compromise, that it would not be rebuffed.  Instead, 
every time I offered something they reduced the offer that they had 
previously been talking to the Majority Leader about.  So it was a 
strange set of events.  But I think what happened was what was a 
significant part of our plan, but not the major part of it, acquired 
a political connotation that got out of proportion to the merits, so 
that a lot of Republicans were saying to me privately, ""Mr. 
President, I'd like to be for this, but I can't now.  And we're all 
strung out and we're divided.""  
	     
	     And I think we need to do a reality check.  As I said, 
what I want to know -- let me go back to what I said -- what I want 
to know from our folks and from our friends in the Senate on -- and 
Republicans or Democrats -- is what could I have done differently to 
make it come out differently.  Because the real losers here were not 
the President and the administration.  The real losers were the 
hundreds of thousands of people who won't have jobs now.  We could 
have put another 700,000 kids to work this summer.  I mean, we could 
have done a lot of good things with that money.  And I think that is 
very, very sad.  And it became more political than it should have.  
But the underlying rationale I don't think holds a lot of water --
that it was deficit spending.  That just won't wash.
	     
	     Q	     and redo --
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.  I mean, you know, for example --you 
mentioned the crime bill.  I think it would be a real mistake not to 
pass the crime bill.  I mean, the crime bill was almost on the point 
of passage last year.  And they were all fighting over the Brady 
Bill.  Surely, surely after what we have been through in this country 
just in the last three months, with the kind of mindless violence we 
have seen, we can pass a bill requiring people to go through a 
waiting period before they buy a handgun.  And surely we can see that 
we need more police officers on the street.  
	     
	     That's another thing that -- I really believe that once 
we move some of that money -- not all, but some of it up into this 
jobs package to make some of the jobs rehiring police officers on the 
street who'd been laid off, that would be a compelling case.  I mean 
people are scared in this country and I think we need to go forward. 
I feel very strongly that we need to go forward on the crime bill.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, back to the tailhook report for a 
second.  That report contained very strong criticism of the Navy's 
senior leadership in general, but did not name any of the senior 
officers.  Do you believe that the senior officers who are implicated 
in this, including Admiral Kelso who was there one night in Las 
Vegas, should they be disciplined and do you believe the public has a 
right to know the names of the senior officers?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  You should know that under the rules of 
law which apply to this, I am in the chain of command.  There is now 
an Inspector General's report and the law must take its course.  If I 
were to answer that question I might prejudice any decisions which 
might be later made in this case.  I don't really think -- I think 
all I can tell you is what I have already said.  I was very disturbed 
by the specific allegations in the Inspector General's report, and I 
want appropriate action to be taken.  
	     
	     Until the proper procedures have a chance to kick in and 
appropriate action is taken, I have been advised that because I am 
the Commander-in-Chief I have to be very careful about what I say so 
as not to prejudice the rights of anybody against whom any action 
might proceed or to prejudice the case in any other way either pro or 
con.  So I can't say any more except to say that I want this thing 
handled in an appropriate and thorough way.
	     
	     Q	  Mr. President, could I ask you for a clarification 
on Bosnia?  You said that you were not considering introduction of 
American forces.  Does that include any air forces as well as ground 
forces, sir?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I said ground forces.
	     
	     Q	  You said ground forces.  Could I ask you, sir, if 
you fear that using U.S. air strikes might  draw the United States 
into a ground war there?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  I just don't want to discuss our 
evaluation of the options anymore.  I've told you that there's never 
been a serious discussion in this country about the introduction of 
ground forces into an ongoing conflict there.
	     
	     Q	  With hundreds of thousands of gays in Washington 
this weekend for the march, did you ever reconsider your decision to 
leave town for this weekend?  Did you ever consider in any way 
participating in some of the activities? 
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  No.
	     
	     Q	  Why not?
	     
	     THE PRESIDENT:  Because I -- and, basically, I wouldn't 
participate in other marches.  I think once you become President, on 
balance, except under unusual circumstances, that is not what should 
be done.  But more importantly, I'm going to the American Society of 
Newspaper Editors, a trip that presumably most of you would want me 
to make, to try to focus anew on what I think are the fundamental 
issues at stake for our country right now.  And I expect that I will 
say something about the fact that a lot of Americans have come here, 
asking for a climate that is free of discrimination; asking, 
basically, to be able to work hard and live by the rules and be 
treated like other American citizens if they do that, and just that.  
And that's always been my position -- not only for the gays who will 
be here, but for others as well.  
	     
	     Thank you very much.

I think that HCI people honestly believe that passing more gun control
laws will be in the best interests of public safety.  Why do I think
this?  Because I used to buy the HCI line.  During my freshman year (1987),
their line made so much sense -- only people who ""need"" guns should be
able to get them, and the people who ""need"" them are the police and
other elites.  Unfortunately for us, this position is highly emotional
and not well thought-out.  They never stop to think that HCI's position
basically says that the non-elite are incompetents (that's you and me,
folks!) and that the Second Amendment has absolutely nothing to do with
hunting or other ""legitimate"" uses (which excludes overthrowing tyrannical
governments and defending yourself when the police have proven they
can't protect you).

Every pro-control person I've talked to is always left  stumped when I
simply argue the facts of gun control (that it has yet to be proven to
lower crime rates) and weapons terminology (and I'm no expert -- but
explaining exactly how an ""evil"" semiautomatic weapon really works
does wonders).

I hvae personally found well-reasoned arguments to be most effective
against the emotional pro-control people.  The trick is to get them to
realize that the Second Amendment exists not for hunters but for the
oppressed and the terrorized.

A-historical bullshit.  Shamir fought the British (who, incidentally,
shipped whole shiploads of Jews back to the Nazis for extermination
and hung those Jewish fighters that they captured and didn't want to
deal with anymore).  Shamir did not attack civilians on airliners,
cruise ships, in airports, sports events, movie theaters, markets,
on buses and children in schoolyards.  Your comparison to a Master
Murderer like Abu Nidal is BLIND!

The major problem with this analysis is that it ignores age.  Even if
Morris were performing as well as Clemens right now, and were likely to
this season, nobody would trade Clemens for Morris straight up because
Clemens has more of his career left.

They aren't functions, they are character arrays. The standard strings
are either defined as string constants or character pointers into
XtShellStrings and XtStrings determined by XTSTRINGDEFINES. Your
libraries were compiled with this defined and your application with it
undefined so simply recompile one or the other. It is probably worth
adding -DXTSTRINGDEFINES to your CFLAGS.

*sigh*

It is standard procedure to suspend law enforcement officers, or re-assign
them to administrative (non enforcement) duties, while an investigation
into possible misconduct is going on. The Administration has given no
indication that such suspensions will occur in this case. And given that
the president, attorney general and governor were all involved in the
decisions that led to the Waco Massacre, they should also suspend all
activities regarding law enforcement. Given their positions, that equates
to an enforced vacation.

For me, it is a ""I believe no gods exist"" and a ""I don't believe gods exist"".
 
In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere
with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly
conclude that when ""A exist"" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the
Pragmatic definition of truth, ""A exists"" is meaningless makes A exist
even logically false.
 
A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god
by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even
make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include
some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting
all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.

Other idea for old space crafts is as navigation beacons and such..
Why not?? If you can put them on ""safe"" ""pause"" mode.. why not have them be

beacon, to take a directional plot on??

Hi boys and girls.  I just bought a Beemer R80GS and realized abruptly that 
I am a grad student.  I first sold my truck yesterday but I need to sell my 
Zephyr too.

If I can sell it this month, great ... insurance and tags both run out in
a couple of weeks.  Otherwise I'll tag and insure it and see what happens.

It's a very sweet bike.  6100 miles, almost all highway (AZ-WY-CO last summer,
plus some great rides between here and the Border.  Purchased new exactly
one year ago (Apr '92), it's a '90 model.  It has a good fairing and a
luggage rack.  Red; very clean.  Perfect maintenance, no bullshit.   I'll spare
any further details other than to say (1) I want to keep it, and (2) somebody
5'7"" +/- 5"" will fit it like a charm.  Not a bike for big people, but not a
small bike.  Standard, upright positioning and good-looking.  Smooth power,
great brakes, good Karma.

Please realize that I am frequently getting in trouble for
straying from orthodoxy, but here is my opinion:

> ... Moreover the Buddha says that we are 
> intrinsically good (as against Christ's ""we are all sinners"").

I never thought of these two ideas being ""against"" each other.
People might quibble about what ""intrinsically"" means but the
reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we
are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good,
but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a 
different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do
not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking 
on water until a little doubt crept in.

Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm ""what is man that you [God] 
should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower 
than the angels""?

I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David
was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath
was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.

Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what
he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments.
I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that
his whole life, probably anticipating an ""attaboy"" from the 
Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything
and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say
how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people.
Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.

Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid
getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing
adultery, we can control our own desires. 

I realize this was not your main point, but I wonder how other
people see this.

(Please forgive any generalizations I am about to make.)

Your point about how ""hard"" other religions are is a good one, just 
as your ""Parting Question"" is a tough question. I think that Muslims
worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name ""submission"".
Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that ""God"" is impersonal. 
Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little
more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater 
to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but
you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more
I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my
conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's
conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology
then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

Are there any former (or present) ""Eastern Religion"" members here 
who could comment?

Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described 
it as a ""seriously handsome car with broad shoulders,"" I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a 
Toyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has 
been reported from the PM article.

    The first thing I would do would be to disband Medicare and Medicade!  They
are a primary reason why health care costs are going up.  To cover the people
that are currently on these programs, I would sell their coverage in blocks
to insurance companies.  The private companies would bid to get these large
blocks of people, and prices would go down.

    To get away from strong federal control on health care, I would pass off
more control to the states.  Everyone is always spewing forth about how 
wonderful Hawaii is doing.  Well, how about giving some other STATES incentive
to try their own plans

    What I would NOT do is try to implement some far reaching federal program
program to cover all Americans, because this is the surest way to fail!

   One sure way to stop throwing money away is to stop giving so much to the
federal government.  Our FEDERAL taxes should be slashed, and our STATE taxes
increased.  A strong central government always fails.  Give power back to the
states/counties/cities, where it belongs.

Compared to the Second Amendment?  I think it's worse.

The problem is, the devil is in the details.  You know, the Brady Bill
sounds like a ""good idea"" too, until you discover that there is NO check,
and that the police DON'T have to allow your purchase even if you check
out, and that you have NO recourse if they don't.

Are there any loopholes here?  I'm no lawyer, I can't be sure.  I
would have never noticed the second one mentioned above in the Brady
Bill, for example.

The more words involved, the more details.  What was that saying about
Abraham Lincoln requiring 200 words to free the slaves, and the modern
Congress requiring 3,000,000 words to describe price controls on rice?

That only works with bad laws.  Good laws are like good computer programs.

But what if the geologists are wrong and these people are warning of a
non-existent danger?  Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both
sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your
respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.

The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from.
Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right
(and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.  

Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently
to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get
offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.

(BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)

Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their
mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines
because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of
discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.

Personally, I don't mind what anyone believes as long as they allow me mine
and we can all live peacefully.

What I was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be
possible to put enough brains on board future deep-space probes
for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the
sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble.  

I heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in
that essentially says ""If you never hear from Earth again,
here's what to do.""  This was a back up in the event a receiver
burnt out but the probe could still send data (limited, but
still some data).  

>Even if you let teh bird drift,  it may  get hosed by some

Since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for
startup, if some type of cosmic BEM took out the probe, it might
not be such a big loss.  Obviously you can't plan for
everything, but the most obvious things can be considered.

The ""`little' things"" above were in reference to Germany, clearly.  People
said that there were similar things in Germany, but no one could name any.
They said that these were things that everyone should know, and that they
weren't going to waste their time repeating them.  Sounds to me like no one

It has *caused* problems?  Again, no one has shown that things were better
before the motto, or that they'd likely be better after.  I don't think
the motto initiates any sort of harassment.  Harassment will occur whether
or not the motto is present.

Maybe you should dig a little further Charles.  Hislop's scholarship was
accepted by the Bristish Oriental Institute which, at the time, was the premere
Institute for Oriental studies.  As I've stated over and over,  I've checked
out about 25% of his references (most are now out of print or in private
libraries) and the likes of Wilkerson and Layard hold their own merit.  THey
too came to the same conclusions and if you will trouble yourself, you will
find that their knowledge of the mysteries have yet to be surpassed.  Both were
highly honored by the British Oriental Museum.  Wilkerson is known as one of
the leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still
being refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He
was recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  

Phony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have
misquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions
do not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his
conclusions are ""spurious"" is without merit.  He gave references to all his
conclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his
conclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the
individual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to
Hislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions
because they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that
the intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown
even to this day in various articles and topics).  THe tongues movement in
Corinth was a direct result of the mysteries entering into the church.  If it
was so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of
seven hills?

Also, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own
conclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the
docrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.  You don't even
have to be a believer to see the parallels.  Just one example.  THe mitre. 
Where did it come from?  Why is it shaped the way it is?  What are the two
tails that hang down the back represent?  Was this an ancient  head dress from
an earlier culture and why was it in Rome at the time of the beginnings of the
church of the State of Rome?  Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,
why did the RCC chose regardless?

Any lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.  Even the
scriptures themselves refer to it.  All Hislop did was collect the information
from all the various sources and put them in one binding.  There is no lack of
scholorship in that.

Please tell me why you discredit this man by your accusation, yet present no
evidence supporting it.

Does anybody have any information on the second generation Broncos? (I'm
not talking about Bronco II's, I'm referring to the Broncos that began
production in 1978 based on the F-150 chassis I believe)

I need to know what to look for, can the tops be removed from all
models, how easily can that be done. Also, what kind of price range
should I be looking at? (i.e. what is blue book) I'm in college right
now, and would like a Jeep. Unfortunately, I've got a bit of a ride to
school, and I need to carry a lot of junk to and from the dormitory in
the spring/fall. I think that the Bronco (with the removable fiberglass)
would be a better (read ""bigger"") choice than a CJ-5 or CJ-7.

Even better: anybody in the Maryland/Virginia area interested in selling
one?

Why don't you just run one LED at 60 KHz and use a flip flop at the receiving

Could someone PLEASE give a guess as to why this simple little program
causes a BadPixmap error on the FOURTH (bizarre???) call to XtRelaizeWidget()?

Here is the code:


int stoploop = 0;

main()

        XtToolkitInitialize();
        XtAppContext app = XtCreateApplicationContext();

                XtAddCallback(box, XmNactivateCallback, Callback, NULL);

                XtRealizeWidget(top);
                while (!stoploop)
                {
                        XEvent event;

                stoploop = 0;
                XtReleaseGC(top, XDefaultGCOfScreen(XtScreen(top))); // needed?
                XtDestroyWidget(top);

        }
}

{
        stoploop = 1;
}


The error I get (yes, the 4TH time I try to show the box) is:

This is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction
between real disease caused by Candida albicans and the ""disease""
that was being asked about, systemic yeast syndrome.

There is no question that Candida albicans causes thrush.  It also
seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous
may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush -- I've 
never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before (though 
presumably it would work by the same mechanism).

Candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major
pathogen.  That does not mean that there is evidence that it causes
the ""systemic yeast syndrome"".

Not at all. Two weeks ago I registered a concern about some programming
that was being conducted by a student organisation here at the
University of Texas at San Antonio.  As a result, I was interrogated
by the capus police, who also attempted to create a positive-identification
file (photo, fingerprints, etc.). I refused to permit this, and filed a
complaint with the University administration.  The Vice-President for
Business Affairs (the 'boss' of the campus police) stated that he had no
interest in the legal/Constitutional implications of those actions.

This seems to be a popular scam with dealers.  Last month my brother bought 
a new Audi 90 series quatro from a local dealer.  They came back with the 
final price, tax and all, and he added it up for himself.  There happened to 
be an extra $300 tagged on under the tax part. He pointed out their error 
and asked them to re-think their addition.  They came back with the right 
price the next time.

Then by your logic, the Jews in Europe in the 1930's were the cause for

You don't see any evidence of the abuse -- therefore it must be taking place?
As you point out everwhere but here, it is irrelevant to this case.  The
ATF is not in charge of investigating child abuse.

In obvious contradiction to the statements made by the F. B. I.

And just what are those actions that you are judging them by?
Their refusal to let the government control their lives? Their refusal
to submit to unconstitutional laws?  Their refusal to behave like
cowards?  Some of Texas' heros could have taken the cowardly way
out too and surrendered the Alamo.  After all, all they had to do was
COME OUT.  They stayed as you say by their ""OWN CHOICE"".  Problem
is not everyone chooses to act like a groveling dog in the face of
insurmountable odds.  But as you point out, they certainly do have
that right.

Bull.  They did, in fact, live a quiet, religious life -- as they claimed.
The warrant was not issued because they ""stockpiled weapons"".  It is
not against the law to own as many guns as you want -- yet (Except in 
Virginia).The warrant was issued for some ""gun parts"" that are about the size 
of a half-dollar.  Certainly worth the lives of so many people, don't you 
think?

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on
the biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to
the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at
least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died
and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up
with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established.
Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in 
Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts. 

What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which
documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.  I would
suggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will be
disapointed.

I've been using MS Access (still available from some stores for $99.00)

to use and somewhat easy to program.  I highly recomend it, particularly
at $99.00!  I have not used Paradox for Windows, but I don't expect it to

Please note that God commanded Adam to work before the fall:

If I run the following from a cmdtool (pwd = my home dir.):

the defaults ""won't take.""

So, I tried to change the xrdb call in my .xinitrc file from:

to:
  xrdb -m $HOME/.Xdefaults

No go.  So I tried adding in:
  xrdb -m /home/kbw/.Xdefaults

Pennicillin if i have everything correct,  was a highly valuable
Myco-toxin,  discovered during WW2.  It proved to have an amazing
Bacterio-cidal effect without human toxicity.   It's immediate
administration  showed immediate dramatic results  solving
problems  that previously were fatal.  Although initially
enormously expensive to culture,  within 3 years,
the price had fallen at least two orders of magnitude,
and within 10 years,  was  not much more expensive then
aspirin.  Penicillin was also usable for an amazingly wide
class of infections.

Centoxin is a drug that is not passing FDA approval.  It promised
amazing results for Toxic shock, a rapidly fatal disease.
It consumed enormous amounts of funding  in testing and
developement,  However it works  less then 1 in 5 times
of administration  and costs $2,000 per administration
with no promise of any reduction in manufacturing cost.
The drug thus costs $10,000 per useful case,  and is
implicated in a slight increase in mortality for some
patients.

I would not dare to compare the shuttle to Pennicillin,
but to centoxin.

It is funny how this one little quote from Genesis is treated
by certain anti-Christians as if Christians have been given a
firm command to destroy the earth. You could prove almost
anything by taking little quotes out of context from the Bible
- it's a big book, you know. I doubt you could find a single
case of a anti-ecological action taking place specifically
because teh perpetrator was motivated by a Christian belief.

As for the Nazis, they were motivated by German Nationalism,
not by Christianity. In fact they despised Christianity as a
weak pacifist religion, and were much more keen on pagan
glorification of strength and warfare. They killed the Jews
because they were not Germans, not because they were
""Christ-killers"" - they were just as keen on killing the other
non-German ethnic minority, the Romanies or Gypsies.

Great speculation - I remember being proud on behalf of all the free
world (you think that way when you are seven years old) that we had
got there first. Now I'm almost sorry that it worked out that way.

I guess the soviets would have taken the victory seriously too, and
would almost certainly not have fallen victim to the complacency that
overtook the US program. Perhaps stretching to match US efforts would
have destabilized them sooner than it did in fact - and in the tradition
of Marvel Comics 'What If', this destabilization in the Brezhnev era might
have triggered the third world war. Hmm, maybe it was a giant leap after all.

: of sky diving.

I'm no astronaut, but I've flown in the KC-135 several times.  I'll
tell you about my first flight.

At the on-set of weightlessness, my shoulders lifted and my spine
straightened.  I felt a momentary panic, and my hands tried to grab
onto something (like the strap keeping me firmly against the floor)
to prevent me from falling; I remember conciously over-ruling my
involuntary motions.  My ears felt (not heard) a rush and I could
feel fluid moving in my head (like when you get up from bed while
you have a cold).

At that point, I ceased to concentrate on my physiological response,
since I had some science to do.  I was busy keeping my experiment
going and keeping track of all the parts during the ""return"" of
gravity and subsequent 1.8-G pull-out, so I didn't really pay
attention to physiology at that time.

After about 5 parabolas, I discovered that I was performing one
of the tricks I've discovered to keep myself from getting motion
sickness; I was keeping my head very still and moving very slowly
-- all except my hands and arms, which needed to be in rapid,
concious motion for my experiment.  During the pull-out to
parabola 5, my queasiness finally started to get to me, and I
had to use one of those air-sickness bags.  I was basically
useless for the rest of that flight, so I went to the seats in
the back of the plane while my partner (whom I drafted for just
this purpose) kept working on the experiment while I was ill.
(He was a vetran Vomit Comet rider, one of those anomalous

On the contrary, after the Holocaust, I would be _very_ cautious about my

These are perfectly valid points and I agree. I'm glad we (MS) are starting
to remedy this situation with DOS 6 (and it will get better in future 
releases). You do need to be aware of some history, however. In the 
mid-late 80's, MS's point of view was that OS/2 was going to take over
the world and DOS would be phased out. As such, resources for DOS
(and windows, for that matter) development were mostly redirected to OS/2.
The theory was to keep just enough resources on DOS to support people
until they started using OS/2, so utilities and such for DOS fell by the 
wayside.

Then Windows 3.0 hit the market, OS/2 flopped (1.x, at least...2.x seems to
be doing a little better, but its future is still cloudy), and people either
stayed with their DOS (3.x and 4.x) apps or moved to Windows. About that
point in time, MS made its decision to drop OS/2 for DOS/Windows in the
short term and Windows/NT in the long term. DOS 5, much improved over DOS
3.x and 4.x, was the first result of MS's refocussing on DOS and Windows.
Version 6 takes things somewhat further and I suspect future versions will
offer even more in terms of ""real"" OS features (I work on NT and have no
real clue about what my coworkers over in DOSland are doing, but I do
know that there are a heck of a lot more of them than there were a
few years ago).

	...Dave

Of course these are my opinions. If you want MS's opinions, as a PR person.

Every time these right-wing control-freaks start spouting

from the Sermon on the Mount [Matt: 6:5-6] ""And when you

Mixers have a wide variety of implementations; the Mini-Circuits
part you mention is a doubly-balanced diode mixer, but active ones
(BJT, FET) seem more popular in consumer receivers.  You might
call MCL; they have a nice catalog.

The universal answer for wide-coverage, theory+practice, RF design
is the _ARRL Handbook_, published by the American Radio Relay
League, the radio amateur organization.  Any technical bookstore
can order you one.  The book is superb, with lots of accessible
theory, construction projects, and generally interesting stuff.

You might also check out _Solid State Design for the Radio Amateur_
(I think), by Hayward and <someone>.  This has sharper design
and test information about subsystems like mixers.

Yes, that is most certainly true. However, the paragrapgh reflects a value-less
position and infers that what is more important than anything else is to
have ""a positive view"" of one's self.

This of course, is foolish.

Should a mass murderer, a pedophile, a 10-year old pyromaniac have a ""positive
view"" of themselves?

Of course not.

A person that engages in behaviour that a large number of people condemn,
and IF you believe in the concept of ""society"", then your only choice is
to expect that person to have a negative view of themselves.

1) It fixes some problems with MicroProse games.  After leaving F-15 III it
would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:.  This has been fixed.  I
don't know what other corrections were made.

2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.

3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a
config.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files
explode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.  It should be self-explanatory from
there.

Suggest McQuires #1 plastic polish.  It will help somewhat but nothing 
will remove deep scratches without making it worse than it already is.
McQuires will do something for fine or light stuff.

Also suggest calling your local plastic shop.  In Calif. ""TAP PLASTIC"" is
a chain that carries most of what is needed for repair and sometimes
replacement of plastic bits.  Telephone in the Bay area is 415-962-8430.
I'm not sure how amenable they are to shipping.  I have found that they
have several excellent products for cleaning, and removing crap from
windscreens and face shields.  Also they have one called ""lift-it"" which
works real well in removing sticky stuffs such as adhessives from plastic
wihtout scratching same.

  Ok, let me see if I can get all this out concisely.  I am on an
information gathering venture regarding the various expressions of
Christianity/churches there are.  
        My husband and I come from very different, but completely
Christian backgrounds.  I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a
born and raised Church of Christ member.  At first I agreed with a lot
of what the C of C was about, I wanted to move from the liturgical
based Lutheran church to something a little more Biblical based.
However over the last year, I've been regretting changing to the
Church of Christ for a number of reasons - for one thing I am not a
fundamentalist and believe that a few things in the Bible are
socio-cultural in nature and don't relate to the Christian doctrine.
One of my sorest spots is the role of women.  I believe that through
Mary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but
in the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I
am told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser
member, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that
verse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in
anything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men
(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).   The last straw
was when the Elders at our church came down on one of our college
groups because it was all-women and they wanted a man to lead the
study.
Also my husband and I really resent the way everyone at our church
feels that if you aren't a conservative republican - you aren't a REAL
Christian (I got told that nobody who voted for Clinton should call
themselves a Christian).  Hence we are subjected during the service to
long prayers calling for things we flatly dont agree with.  We are
also don't agree with the C of C's dread of any new ""movement"" being
led by the young people.

So, we have been church hunting with NO success.  I want a reasonably
biblical based church where women are viewed as whole people no matter
what their calling ( C of C really looked down on career women).
Christopher is looking for a church with deeply rooted religious
convictions, with adult baptism and a church where the members still
bring their Bibles to service.

We are so confused here and we're drifting around trying to find a
place where we both feel loved and can express our faith honestly and
without reservation.  If anyone can point us in a direction we'd be
thrilled!
I'm afraid that it will be very hard for me to go back to C of C and
even harder for me to stay churchless for long.

any responses would be welcome

[I would think somewhere in the Baptist spectrum you might find what
you're looking for.  However the issue is probably more one of the
flavor of the specific local churches in your area than the
denomination -- Baptists cover quite a spectrum.  Adult baptism sort
of narrows your choices on the more liberal end of the spectrum.
Historically that's been associated with movements that have the
character you're trying to avoid.  --clh]

Unless you run `xlock -mode blank`, xlock consumes CPU time generating

Well, there already is a sulfate process for TiO2 purification.  The
chlorine process is cleaner, however, and for that reason is achieving
dominance in the marketplace.

Most Ti is used in pigment, btw (as the oxide), where it replaced
white lead pigment some decades ago.  Very little is reduced to the
metal.

[again, poseted for a friend]

Okay, I got such great response from my last question (thanks, everyone), 
lets try again:

How can I tell if a colorcell is read-only?

I want to use any read-only cells that are already in my colormap
once I start running out of allocatable cells, using some arbitrary
nearest color matching scheme to get those cells that come closest to
a requested color.

Once I determine if a cell is read-only, I assume I can then just request
an XAllocColor() with the exact same color specifications and it will 
then be flagged as 'used' by my application so that it doesn't later get
freed by someone else and allocated again as read-write to another
application.

So far, the only way I've figured out to do this is to write my own
error handler and just go ahead and request the cells colors, once my
colormap is all full up.  It should error out if the cell is non-shareable.
But life would be much easier if I could just detect the
read-only/shareable stuff directly...

Any ideas?

Reply-To: spart@cs.uq.oz.au

Is it possible to buy a serial I/O card with the 16550 UART's built in
(rather than having to buy them separately, and socketing them in)?

My current I/O card uses 8250's (correct number? The braindead ones anyway).
It also controls two floppy drives, and two IDE hard drives.

Ideally, I'd like to get a new multi I/O card, that had 2 serial ports with
16550's and could also control another 2 IDE HD's. It would have to have
configurable addresses for both the serial ports, and the IDE controller, so
it could co-exist with my existing card.

Does such a beast exist? Now the hard part - where can I get one in Australia,
preferably Brisbane?

I've got an 89 GT.  It has the smoked taillight assembly.  I think this is where
the water is getting in.  When I first got it (had it for a month), one of the rear
taillights fogged up with moisture.  I took it in to the dealer and they replaced
the entire assembly.  It happened to the other one about 3 months later.  This time
I happened to look in the spare tire well and noticed water standing in there.  The
dealer was more reluctant this time to replace it.  But I convinced them to
fix it.  (They must have had to deal with a number of other probes with the same
problem.)  I haven't noticed water in the taillamps (or the trunk) for the last 2.5
years, but just last month, the taillamp just fogged up again.  I'm going to try
to take it back to get them to fix it again.  I'm real tempted to drill some vent
and drain holes in the tops and bottoms of the assembly and forget about it.  This is
getting very annoying. (Almost every other `89 GT I've seen has had this problem.)

	Excellent point, Mark.  We should all remember that if Nixon

I haven't read this entire thread, but, if someone hasn't tossed this out yet, then here it is: 

2 Samuel 12:21-23 (RSV) : 

  ""Then his servants said to him, `What is this thing that you have
  done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when
  the child died, you arose and ate food.' He [David] said, 'While the
  child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, 'Who knows
  whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?' But
  now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall
  go to him, but he will not return to me.'""

Anyhow, many interpret this to mean that the child has gone to Heaven
(where David will someday go). I don't claim to know for sure if this
applies to all babies or not. But even if it's just this one, what
would you say to this?

It seems that a particular program designed for blind people is more important
than trying to interface windows with a way for blind people to use it.
If someone made a voice recognition/multimedia (sound) oriented program,
it would probably been more effective.  I don't know what the original
purpose of interfacing windows was for the person who posted the question

We need terrain data for a visualization research currently taking place
in Tel-Aviv university. We have two databases that we are currently working
on, but we would like to work on more databases, possibly more complicated 
and ones that will give prettier images.

Before I describe what kind of data we need, let me mention that we are 
going to present a paper titled ""Photo-Realistic Imaging of Digital Terrains""
which describes the research and the results, in the EUROGRAPHICS'93 
conference in Barcelona, this september. We are going to show a video-tape 
with some of our results, so any good data that we will receive will be 
presented in the tape, with a mention of the donator.

We are working on databases consisting of aerial or satelite photographs, 
and terrain elevation maps (DTM). 
Each database consists of a 2D array of height values (any data format can
be used for each value), and a corresponding 2D array of color values (can
be gray-level, 256-color value or full 24-bit R/G/B values. Other format can
also be used). We work on 512X512 and 1024x1024 resolution databases.

If anybody has access to this kind of data, or knows where we can get such
data files, please respond in this news group, or - better - email us
directly :

amit@math.tau.ac.il    (Amit Shaked), or
danny@indigo.bgu.ac.il (Daniel Cohen)

Of course, the names of the people who will help us get the data will be
cited in our paper, and in further publications.

The NASM photo archives are open to the public.  All (or almost all)

We've been using it for a year on Unix (Sun and HP) and Windows platforms.  In my
opinion, it is the best toolkit on the market.  It supports a rich API to a high

>What *does* it take to play on a WS winning club?

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-
tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-
ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best
that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the
best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-
cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re-
lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that
is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the
only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-
ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-
jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.

>The fact is that Morris didn't ""win"" any ballgames, Toronto did, in
>spite of Morris' ""contribution"".   This has been explained to you

Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.

>many, many times and you are either too stupid or too stubborn to grasp it.

You don't have to be rude.

>You are completely consumed by the post hoc, ergo propter hoc fallacy.

For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio
Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed
that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-
formance.

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better
than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.

From the benchmarks I've seen (was that in MacUser or MacWeek?) the FPU-less
Centris 610 is _faster_ at floating-point operations (the kind of calculations
that get routed to an FPU) than a Mac IIfx!

And a Mac IIfx (68030 @ 40MHz + FPU) is _the_ fastest 030-based Mac.

Take note, of course, that benchmarks never tell the whole story... Get your
favorite program(s) and run them on both machines at the store.  They should
let you do that before you plunk down a hefty amount...

Like conversing with a brick wall. And you are not responding to what I 
am writing. By the way, that ""bullshit"" is justly regarded as the first 
instance of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.
For nearly one thousand years, the Turkish and Kurdish people lived 
on their homeland - the last one hundred under the oppressive Soviet 
and Armenian occupation. The persecutions culminated in 1914: The 
Armenian Government planned and carried out a Genocide against its 
Muslim subjects. 2.5 million Turks and Kurds were murdered and the 
remainder driven out of their homeland. After one thousand years, 
Turkish and Kurdish lands were empty of Turks and Kurds. 

The survivors found a safe heaven in Turkiye.

Today, x-Soviet Armenian government rejects the right of Turks and 
Kurds to return to their Muslim lands occupied by x-Soviet Armenia.

Today, x-Soviet Armenia covers up the genocide perpetrated by its 
predecessors and is therefore an accessory to this crime against 
humanity.

x-Soviet Armenia must pay for its crime of genocide against the Muslims 
by admitting to the crime and making reparations to the Turks and Kurds.

 And one recalls that the Jews took up their abode in 'fanatic' Turkey
 when they were expelled from Europe, especially Spain, by Saintly Christians,
 and they have lived here for centuries in at least as much tranquility and
 liberty as their fellow Turkish subjects, all being exposed alike to the
 rapacity of their common rulers. To one brought up, as most Americans have 
 been, in the Gladstonian and foreign-missionary tradition, the condition of 
 the Jews in Turkey is almost a mathematical demonstration that religious
 differences have had an influence in the tragedy of Turkey only as they
 were combined with aspirations for a political separation which every 
 nation in the world would have treated as treasonable. One readily 
 reaches the conclusion that the Jews in Turkey were fortunate..."" 

He also stated that:

""they [Armenians] traitorously turned Turkish cities over to the Russian

 fifty thousand men to fight a civil war, and that they burned at least
 a hundred Turkish villages and exterminated their population.""

It could be, perhaps, your head wasn't screwed on just right. In 1941, 
while the Jews were being assembled for their doom in the Nazi concentration 
camps, the Armenian volunteers in Germany formed the first Armenian 
battalion to fight alongside the Nazis. In 1943, this battalion had 
grown into eight battalions of 20,000-strong under the command of the
former guerilla leader Dro (the butcher), who was the former dictator of the
short-lived Armenian Dictatorship (1918-1920) and the architect of the 
cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds between 1914-1920.
An Armenian National Council was formed by the notorious Dashnak Party 
leaders in Berlin, which was recognized by the Nazis. Encouraged by 
this, the Armenians summarily formed a provisional government that endorsed 
and espoused fully the principles of the Nazis and declared themselves as the 
members of the Aryan super race and full participants to Hitler's policy of 
extermination of the Jews.

This Armenian-Nazi conspiracy against the Jews during WWII was an ""encore""
performance staged by the Armenians during WWI, when they back-stabbed and
exterminated 2.5 million Turks by colluding with the invading Russian army.

Furthermore, as McCarthy put it, the Armenian dictatorship was granted
a respite when the Ottomans admitted defeat and signed the Mudros
Armistice with the Allies (October 30, 1918). The Allies had decided
to create a Greater Armenia, including the old Russian province
of Yerevan and adjoining areas, as well as most parts of Anatolia
claimed by the Armenian fanatics. Only the area called Cilicia
(around the Ottoman province of Adana) was to be excluded, as it
had already been claimed by the French. The Allies quickly set
about attempting to disarm Ottoman soldiers and other Turks, who
could be expected to oppose their plans. 

On April 19, 1919 the British Army occupied Kars, gave civilian
and military power over to the Armenians, then withdrew. The British
planned for Kars to be included in the Armenian Dictatorship, even 
though the Russian pre-war census had shown Kars Province to be over
60% Muslim. The Turks of Kars were effectively disarmed, but the 
British could not disarm the Kurds of the mountains. The fate of
the Turks was almost an exact replica of what had occurred earlier
in Eastern Anatolia. Murder, pillage, genocide and the destruction
of Turkish homes and entire Turkish villages drove the Turks of
Kars to the mountains or south and west to the safety afforded
by remaining units of the Ottoman Army. The British had left 
the scene to the Armenian genocide squads. Therefore, few 
Europeans were present to observe the genocide. One British
soldier, Colonel Rawlinson, who was assigned to supervise the
disarmament of Otoman soldiers, saw what was occurring. 

Rawlinson wired to his superiors, 

""in the interest of humanity the Armenians should not be left in
 independent command of the Moslim population, as, their troops 
 being without discipline and not being under effective control,
 atrocities were constantly being committed.""

""The situation in the cities of Erzincan and Erzurum which we have 
 recently taken over is given below:

 These two beautiful cities of our country which are alike in the
 calamities and destruction which they suffered, have been destroyed,
 as the specially designed and built public and private buildings of
 these cities were deliberately burnt by Armenians apart from the 
 destruction suffered during the two-year Russian occupation.

 All barracks buildings of Erzincan, the cavalry barracks in Erzurum,
 the Government building and Army Corps Headquarters are among those
 burnt. In short, both cities are burnt, destroyed and trees cut down.

 As to the people of these cities:

 All people old enough to use weapons rounded up, taken to the Sarikamis
 direction for road building and were slaughtered. The remaining people,
 were subject to cruelties and murder by Armenians following the 
 withdrawal of Russians and were partly annihilated the corpses thrown 
 into wells, burnt in houses, mutilated by bayonets, their abdomens
 ripped open in slaughterhouses, their lungs and livers torn out, girls
 and women hung up by their hair, after all kinds of devilish acts.
 The few people who were able to survive these cruelties, worse than
 those of the 'Spanish Inquisition,' are in poverty more dead than alive,
 horrified, some driven insane, about 1500 in Erzincan and 30,000 in
 Erzurum. The people are hungry and in poverty, for whatever they had
 has been taken away from them, their lands left uncultivated.

 The people have just been able to exist with some provisions found in
 stores left over from the Russians. The villages round Erzincan and 
 Erzurum are in the worst condition. Some villages on the road, have 
 been leveled to the ground, leaving no stone, the people completely
 massacred.

 Let me submit to your information with deep grief and regret that
 history has never before witnessed cruelties at such dimensions.""

Every so often, the Pope declares that some departed Christian is
now in Heaven, and may be invoked in the public rites of the Church.
It is my understanding that Roman Catholics believe that such
declarations by the Pope are infallible. I see three possibilities:
     1) The Church has received a Public Revelation since the death
of (for example) Joan of Arc.
     2) The Church was given a list before the death of St John
which had Joan's name on it.
     3) There is no public revelation about Joan, and Roman
Catholics are free to doubt that she died in a state of grace, or
even that she is a historical character.

The green layer is a solder-mask, and is used to make a finished board
look neat, and to avoid solder bridges, especially when using wave
soldering (or any other mechanized approach). I've seen red mask,
but most that I've seen are green.

A bakelite board will look brown in colour, and, if the solder mask
is put on, looks like a brown board with green 'paint' on either side
(or just one side) of the board.
A fibreglass board will look green from the side, because the green
solder-mask makes the board appear that colour. If you got a fibreglass
board with no mask, it would be a whitish-grey colour.
Teflon boards do exist, as well... but I'm not sure about that one.

I'd guess the stuff they invented for solder mask was green, so they're
not about to change. Also, any change in any chemical probably requires
a better than normal cleaning of the machines that make boards. A lot
of companies do not make their own boards... they ship them to a real
boardhouse.

I don't know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist.
No scientist would take your statement --- ""no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome"" --- to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question.  Noring has pointed out
the catch-22 that if the ""crazy"" theory were true, you probably couldn't
find any direct evidence of it --- that you couldn't observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there.  Noring and the
fellow from Oklahoma (sorry, forgot your name) have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences ---
namely, that when people with certain conditions are given anti-fungals,
many of them appear to get better.  

So, if you have any evidence *against* the hypothesis --- for example,
controlled double-blind studies showing that the anti-fungals don't do any
better than sugar water --- then let's hear it.  If you don't, then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side, and abject
disbelief on the other.  In which case, please, there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative.  

And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight, making wild claims with no evidence, and always refusing to do
controlled studies.  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti-fungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases.  There are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase, in spite of the fact that it's
completely broken down in the guts, but this doesn't change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage.  Same thing.  Just cause there are candida quacks, that
doesn't establish evidence against the candida hypothesis.  If there's some
other reason (besides the quacks), if only anecdotal, to think it could be
true, then that is what has to be considered, that is what the net people
have been talking about.

But again, there is no point in arguing about it.  There is anecdotal
evidence, and there is no convincing evidence, and there are also some
candida quacks out there, I hope everyone can agree on all of that.  Thus,
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double-blind
study of antifungals (or else, forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test, just carry it out themselves!) --- and also, whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis.

	The honest answer to your question about Arabs who were expelled
from Jaffa, and/or who fled Jaffa, or anywhere else in Israel, having
the right to return is:  Yes, unfortunately, they have the right to
return.  They may apply for citizenship like any other non-Israeli and
then go to >Jaffa and try to buy their house back from the Jews who now
own it.  

	And now a question and answer for you:  Can the Jews who were
born and raised in Hebron, or their descendants go back to THEIR homes
in Hebron?  The answer is: absolutely NOT, because they were almost all
murdered by their Arab neighbors - the ""palestinians"".

	Now, do I think the Arabs should be allowed to even visit
""their"" homes in Jaffa?  Hell, no.  Bring back the Jews of Hebron, Petah
Tikva, Jerusalem, Safed, etc. Then, perhaps I would be in favor of Arabs
returning to their Jaffa homes.  However, seeing as no Arab has yet been
able to bring people back from the dead, I'd say that's out.

I'm working on an application where we are creating a dither pattern 
and rendering it in a window by applying it to the stipple pattern 
of the GC.  The following code segment almost works if the window width 
is an even multiple of 8.  If it is not an even multiple it skews the 
pattern towards the right.  Another problem, whether it is an even 
multiple of 8 or not, is a series of vertical lines spaced 8 pixels 
apart.

Just thought of something.  Yes, laptops can still be read, but it's not quite
as easy as a normal pc with a CRT.  My thought, Airline pilots lately have
been complaining about how laptops being used in flight mess with the plane's
instruments.  If this can be hyped up, manufacturers may start building
laptops with even lower emmisions.  It would probably still be possible to
pick up with surveillance equipment, but at this point, it would be a lot
cheaper to mask the remaining signals with TEMPEST techniques.

This is misleading, at best.  The question, really, has to do with the
status of the Greek Septuagint versus Hebrew scripture.  And the issue
predates the Reformation by quite a bit -- Jerome was negative about the
""deuteroncanonicals"" and in fact, even though he transalted them, he put
them after the Hebrew canon (reordered from the Greek ordering to the
Hebrew one.)  His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he
reports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just
dictating his translation to an amanuensis.

That is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in
Western Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the
first steps in ""reducing"" these books from the status they had (and have)
among the Greeks.

Furthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers ""threw out"" these
books.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome
had already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should
not be based on citations from these ALONE.

I think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it
seems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as
part of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)
are confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems
to play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow
""more inspired"" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable
-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God's word to the Jews in
Greek (or German, or English, ...).  This tendency seems to have got a
big boost in _sola scriptura_ Protestantism, even to the point of current
""inerrancy"" bizarreness, despite the more basic, underlying tendency of
the Reformers to see that the texts SHOULD and COULD be translated.  If
we can profit from an English rendering of Hebrew and Greek, there is
surely little reason to keep Sirach, at least, out of our Bibles (and of
course, Anglicans don't do so :-)).  For texts originally in Greek, it
would seem more to be anti-Greek prejudice (notably, by the time the
Hebrew canon is fully attested, including anti-Christian prejudice which
led to the Jewish abandonment of the Septuagint) which is operative.

BTW: readers may enjoy some lectures of Bruce Metzger on the issues of
translation of the Bible (including some of what I said about Jerome,
above) in the current numbers of the journal _Bibliotheca Sacra_; two
of four have been published so far.

IMHO Bowman is the perfect coach for this group of players at

group of players. I would say we have been very lucky here in 
Pittsburgh that the order these coaches came in was this one. 
(Excluding the unfortunate circumstances which brought about the 
change.) With the immense talent on the Penguins roster this

other hand, was able to inspire the younger, inexperienced players 
to new heights. Both coaches have / had different strengths. Both 
of which came at exactly the right time. 

Another person also mentioned that Bowman is the perfect coach 
for this time since nobody can argue with his decisions. How can 
you argue with the coach with the best record in hockey anyway? 
Playing for a great coach like that demands respect which also 
keeps the egos in check. 

Just a couple of ideas.

There are several things in ITAR which have never been tested in court. 
The concensus appears to be:

You could be arrested as an international arms trafficker.  (You could,
regardless of the state of the law, but there are some paragraphs which
suggest you would be violating the law.)

If it goes to court, the ITARs could be thrown out is incompatible with the
First amendment; or the court could rule that ""software"" is ""technical

be prosecuted successfully for arms trafficing or espionage.  General
concensus among lawyers who have read the ITARs, is that one of the first
two would occur.

The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is
that a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton
has a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps
if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players
such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with
his revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this
money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses.

I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.  
I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but 
he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has ""sucked"" revenue
out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.
Pocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oiler
team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship.
As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects
to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or
draft picks.

Jim and Andy both have it incorrect I believe:

The *facts* are what is there, the processes that exist in the
present or the physical evidence of the processes having occured
in the past. These *facts* exist with or without a theory.

The *theory* tries and explains the *facts* and how they relate
to the rest of the physical universe in a manner that is both
coherent and useful, that it can be used to make predictions.

The *facts* of gravity, evolution, electromagnetic radiation,
relativity, atoms will exist and behave in the way in which they
behave regardless of whether we have a theory to try and explain
how they interact... or even why.

A theory never really becomes a fact... but a theory can predict
the existence of a previously unknown fact, and if we find this
fact as the theory predicted we say the *theory* is *supported*
by the *facts*. A theory is a mental construct, a speculation, 
a model.  If it is a good model, it may be useful.

In science a theory is something that is supported by the 
evidence, considerable evidence, sometimes *all* of the evidence.
A *hypothesis* is a new fledgling theory because there is not
yet enough evidence to support it.  When a new hypothesis 
is proposed to replace an existing theory, it must explain
*all* of the facts that the current theory explains and at least
some of the facts that the current theory could not and/or
predict new facts.

It is so simple.... I'm surprised that this subject gets
beat to death about once a month. A quick glance in a dictionary
would clear up 99% of the confusion and bandwidth in this
newsgroup.  Then we could talk about really important things
like, why do men have nipples?

     Really now.  Why is this the pot calling the kettle black?  I am stating
that a person who shows a continually biased opinion is close-minded and that
his opinion should be ignored.  Clayton is stating that a group of at least
two million (1%) American citizens are evil vicious malicious child-molesters.

     Here's a hypothetical question...  If Clayton said something like ""all
those niggers are really stupid.""  (Please don't be offended, I'm not racist
but merely using an example of Clayton's malign logic).  And then said he
read a report that a lot of blacks in inner cities dropped out of school, I
bet he wouldn't have your support.  Yet he can claim that all homosexuals are
dishonest, evil, lying child molesters without *PERSONALLY* having a single
homosexual friend or acquaintance and you'll sit there and support him.

     God created a place for bigots.  It's called Hell and Clayton is going
to burn there for a long time.  I pray for him to find in his heart the
Christian values he espouses so that he can learn to love his gay brothers
and sisters, because anyone with so much hatred in his soul coulld never
be righteous.

Well, they can't listen in on much of mine, since I already use
cryptography for much of my electronic mail, and will start using it
for my telephony as soon as practical.

However, allow me to tell a parable.

There was once a far away land called Ruritania, and in Ruritania
there was a strange phenonmenon -- all the trees that grew in
Ruritainia were transparent. Now, in the days when people had lived in
mud huts, this had not been a problem, but now high-tech wood
technology had been developed, and in the new age of wood, everyone in
Ruritania found that their homes were all 100% see through. Now, until
this point, no one ever thought of allowing the police to spy on
someone's home, but the new technology made this tempting. This being
a civilized country, however, warrants were required to use binoculars
and watch someone in their home. The police, taking advantage of this,
would get warrants to use binoculars and peer in to see what was going
on. Occassionally, they would use binoculars without a warrant, but
everyone pretended that this didn't happen.

One day, a smart man invented paint -- and if you painted your house,
suddenly the police couldn't watch all your actions at will. Things
would go back to the way they were in the old age -- completely
private.

Indignant, the state decided to try to require that all homes have
video cameras installed in every nook and cranny. ""After all"", they
said, ""with this new development crime could run rampant. Installing
video cameras doesn't mean that the police get any new capability --
they are just keeping the old one.""

A wise man pointed out that citizens were not obligated to make the
lives of the police easy, that the police had survived all through the
mud hut age without being able to watch the citizens at will, and that
Ruritania was a civilized country where not everything that was
expedient was permitted. For instance, in a neighboring country, it
had been discovered that torture was an extremely effective way to
solve crimes. Ruritania had banned this practice in spite of its
expedience. Indeed, ""why have warrants at all"", he asked, ""if we are
interested only in expedience?""

A famous paint technologist, Dorothy Quisling, intervened however. She
noted that people might take photographs of children masturbating
should the new paint technology be widely deployed without safeguards,
and the law was passed.

Soon it was discovered that some citizens would cover their mouths
while speaking to each other, thus preventing the police from reading
their lips through the video cameras. This had to be prevented, the
police said. After all, it was preventing them from conducting their
lawful surveilance. The wise man pointed out that the police had never
before been allowed to listen in on people's homes, but Dorothy
Quisling pointed out that people might use this new invention of
covering their mouths with veils to discuss the kidnapping and
mutilation of children. No one in the legislature wanted to be accused
of being in favor of mutilating children, but then again, no one
wanted to interfere in people's rights to wear what they liked, so a
compromise was reached whereby all homes were installed with
microphones in each room to accompany the video cameras. The wise man
lamented few if any child mutilations had ever been solved by the old
lip reading technology, but it was too late -- the microphones were
installed everwhere.

However, it was discovered that this was insufficient to prevent
citizens from hiding information from the authorities, because some of
them would cleverly speak in languages that the police could not
understand. A new law was proposed to force all citizens to speak at
all times only in Ruritanian, and, for good measure, to require that
they speak clearly and distinctly near the microphones. ""After all"",
Dorothy Quisling pointed out, ""they might be using the opportunity to
speak in private to mask terrorist activities!""  Terrorism struck
terror into everyone's hearts, and they rejoiced at the brulliance of
this new law.

Meanwhile, the wise man talked one evening to his friends on how all
of this was making a sham of the constitution of Ruritania, of which
all Ruritanians were proud. ""Why"", he asked, ""are we obligated to
sacrifice all our freedom and privacy to make the lives of the police
easier? There isn't any real evidence that this makes any big dent in
crime anyway! All it does is make our privacy forfeit to the state!""

However, the wise man made the mistake of saying this, as the law
required, in Ruritanian, clearly and distinctly, and near a
microphone.  Soon, the newly formed Ruritanian Secret Police arrived
and took him off, and got him to confess by torturing him. Torture
was, after all, far more efficient than the old methods, and had been
recently instituted to stop the recent wave of people thinking obscene
thoughts about tomatoes, which Dorothy Quisling noted was one of the
major problems of the new age of plenty and joy.

>Could this be because everyone is born with original sin?

(I presume you are quoting John 3:3-7.)

1.  My King James Bible says ""Except a man be born of water 
and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God"" 
(John 3:5).  (Here ""man"" == ""adult"").
(However, this could be a quibble between translations.)

2.  We can also analyze to whom the Lord is addressing:
""Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again""
(John 3:7).  Here Jesus is clearly directing his remarks
to Nicodemus -- a ruler of the Jews (not a child).

3.  We can ask ourselves why the Lord would even 
introduce the concept of spiritual re-birth through
baptism if newborn babies weren't free from sin?

A IDLER

[Yup, in John 3:5 ""man"" is not in the original.  A better translation
is ""no one can enter..."", as in NRSV.  Of course in 3:7, Jesus is
addressing the person who came to him.  There are other places in the
NT where he deals with children.  They've been mentioned in other
postings.  --clh]

Sigh.

Farwell LA, Donchin E. The truth will out: Interrogative polygraphy (""lie
detection"") with event-related brain potentials. Psychophysiology
1991;28:531-547

""The research reported here was supported in part by contract number 87F350800
with the Central Intelligence Agency. Preliminary reports were presented at the
1986, 1988, and 1989 meetings of the Society for Psychophysiological Research"".

Donchin happens to be an Israeli.

Do you really think that Israel needs something as primitive as torture when it
has THIS as well as something brought over by a Russian mathematician from the
Lenningrad Military Hospital in 1979  (factor-analysis of multiple unit
activity of the brain) ???  Surely you jest.

When Israel sics trained dogs on Arab prisoners the way it's commonly done on
prison farms in Mississippi or Alabama, *then* you have a right to protest
against torture. When Israeli security personnel beat Arab prisoners the way
Chicago police do, *then* you have a right to complain. Since it does NOT
practice physical torture in any way, kindly refrain from using this word.

""You are the light of the world. A city can't be hidden lying on a
mountaintop. Nor do people light a candle and cover it with a big
basket; they put it up on a tall candlestick where it can shine for
everyone in the house. That's how your light must shine in front of the
world, so that people see your good deeds and give credit to your Father
in the skies. Don't think I came to dissolve The Law [Torah aka First

dissolve them, I came to fulfill them. I assure you, till the sky and
the earth go away, not one letter or punctuation mark of The Law will
ever go away until everthing has come to pass. So anyone who dissolves
even one of the smallest commandments and teaches others the same way,
will be known as the lowest in the kingdom of the skies; whereas anyone
who keeps the commands and teaches them too, will be known as someone
great in the kingdom of the skies.""  Matt5:14-19, Gaus, ISBN:0-933999-99-2

In the part of the posting you have so helpfully deleted, I

On the question, ""Does God hear the prayers of sinners?"" we need to
distinguish.

If we say that He never hears the prayers of any who have sinned, we
make pointless all prayers by anyone born less than 19 centuries
ago.

But if we consider the prayers of the impenitent sinner, of someone
who says, ""Lord, I want you to do this for me, but don't expect me
to change my way of life,"" that is a different matter. Even here, I
would not venture to say that God never grants such petitions (just
as He sends sun and rain on the evil and on the good). However, if
someone we know well is praying to God in that spirit, we might have
the responsibility to say, ""Remember, if God's help is real, then so
are His commands.""

How can the government tell which encryption method one is using without
being able to decode the traffic? i.e., In order to accuse me of using an
unauthorized strong encryption technique they would have to take both
keys out of escrow, run them against my ciphertext and ""draw a blank"".

I can imagine the ciphertext exhibiting certain statistical
characteristics that might give a clue as to the encryption technique
used, but not enough to give a handle for diferential cryptoanalysis.
However, superencipherment or some other scheme that shapes the percieved
properties of my ciphertext could thwart this.

Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private

is required only for the use of public roads.

We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and
usually only two candidates for a given office. A President
might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create
a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to)
and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the
civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote
for the ""lesser of two evils."" I don't think this is a matter
of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York
and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to 
create a virtual ban.

>Guns 'n Criminals:
>MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.
>Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.

In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws:
According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals
legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's
the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing
guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish
this.

>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:
>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!

How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for
owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting,
target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't
their only (or even a common) use.

>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them
>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,
>it's the 'axer' ??

I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation
of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different,
in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that
primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had
not done anything wrong.

>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect
>themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??

A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal 
with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course,
it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But
at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social
problems? 

>If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have
>guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)

There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes.
In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places
where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those
where guns are less common.

>LAST WORD:
>Responsible gun owners are not a problem, but they will be affected if
>you want to protect your citicens.

This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government
and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish
or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some
vague ""common good.""

       Texas is unusual in this regard.  It would be nice to reduce them

       As Texas doesn't appear to have an murder rate that much higher than

       Here's where we run into a problem.  I am perfectly willing to
have government regulation on something which is likely to cause others
harm.  What we're discussing, though, is the extreme regulation of a large
group in order to target a small group, and I don't think that's
appropriate.

        Does this, then, justify anything?  At some point you have to draw
a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have
something a little more substantial than a set of percentages with which
to punish an individual.

        Where do *you* draw the line?  Or is there one?

        Virginia.  It passed.

        Cute analogy. 

        The U.S. doesn't treat drunk driving like a serious crime.  However,
we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate
*all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal
system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property
confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual.
That is, it isn't enough to show that the majority of people convicted of
murder are white  in order to convict a particular white guy of murder.

In some circumstances. I was at a public meeting last night (in the USA), where
a protester, who was very nice and calm, and just said before the
speaker started to beware of his opinions, was forced out of the meeting by
two armed policemen.

There are a lot of things that one cannot do in the USA. You may not
notice them, but as an Australian visitor, I notice them.

Yes, we are lucky at the moment. I hope that is still true in
a few years time. Because it didn't just happen...it required concious
effort.

That would be neat, but nowhere in the Bible does it say
that one who has the gift of tounges can do this.  If the gift
of tounges were the ability to be understood by everyone,
no matter what languages they know, there would be no need for the
gift of interpretation, and I Corinthians 14 would not have had to
have been written.

That's a pretty harsh assumption to make about a several million
Christians world wide.  Sure, there are some who want glory
for themselves who speak in tounges, just as there are among those
who do not have this gift.  There were people like this in the Corinthian
church also.  that does not mean that there is no true gift or that all
who speak in tounges do it for their own glory in the sight of men.  
I would venture to say that a large percentage of those who do speak in tounges 
do so more often in private prayer than in public.

You implied that anyone who wants to send troops to Bosnia wants to do so to
help the ""butchers of their choice"".  Since the primary targets of help are
Muslim victims of ""ethnic cleansing"", you imply that such Muslim victims are
butchers.

>1) People become butchers by butchering.  There have been atrocities on all

This implies both sides are equal.  True, it may sometimes be difficult or
impossible to determine which side is the victim, but that does not mean that
victims do not exist.  Would you, in WWII have said that there were atrocities
on the sides of both the Jews and the Germans?

>These people have been butchering each other for centuries.  When one
>side wins and gets what it wants, it will stop.

Yes, but both sides want different things.  The Muslims chiefly want to not
be ""ethnic cleansed"".  The Serbians want to ""ethnic cleanse"" the Muslims.  It
is indeed true that each side will stop when it gets what it wants, but the
things that the two sides want are not equivalent.

I recall, before we did anything for Somalia, (apparent) left-wingers saying
that the reason everyone was more willing to send troops to Bosnia than to
Somalia was because the Somalis are third-worlders who Americans consider
unworthy of help.  They suddenly shut up when the US decided to send troops to
the opposite place than that predicted by the theory.

For that matter, this theory of yours suggests that Americans should want to
help the Serbs.  After all, they're Christian, and the Muslims are not.  If
the desire to intervene in Bosnia is based on racism against people that are
less like us, why does everyone _want_ to help the side that _is_ less like us?
Especially if both of the sides are equal as you seem to think?

Hi,

I've got a Victor PC/XT with a 20 MB harddisk in it. The controller is
a Toshiba MFM controller, with an additional 9 pins connector.

There are 2 busses from my harddisk to this controller. One with 9 wires
and another with 34 wires.

The controller has two connectors for a 9 wire-bus and one for a 34 wire
bus.

Now I got a 20 MB harddisk from a friend of mine, and I wondered whether
I can connect this second harddisk to the same controller (there is room
for a 9 wire-bus, but not for the 34 wire bus)

How can I solve my problem, any suggestions?

The trouble with trying to find out the truth is that Roehm and his
buddies were ACCUSED OF being flaming faggots, one of the pretexts for the
Night of Long Knives in which Roehm and most of the SA wing of the NSDAP
were purged.  Since the accusers thereafter controlled the records,
anything bearing on the subject -- true or not -- has to be considered
tainted evidence.  The available data suggest that Roehm and his crowd,
the SA -- Sturmabteilung, ""Storm Troopers"" -- left the world a better

      Well, I dropped by the library yesterday, and picked up back copies
of the National Crime Survey (1986-1990) in an effort to examine what
it said about self-defense with a firearm.

      I haven't ground through much in the way of numbers yet, but a couple
of things jumped out at me.  First only 1986 and 1987 specify the type of
weapon used in self defense.  1988, 1989, and 1990 refer only to ""weapon.""
The second is that while assaults rose about 3% from 1986 to 1987, w/gun
defenses reported *fell* by almost 25%.  Unless there's an explanation for
this, I'm tempted to mark it as a reporting problem, and as such going 
ahead with any examination of the numbers would be a waste of time.

      Anybody have an idea what might have cause a real difference, and
not just a reporting difference?  The survey doesn't appear to have
changed significantly between 1986 and 1987.

Mox nix.  The BD's were prepared to provide their own heat and light,
and were doing so for weeks while the power was out.  That means the
compound contained containers of flammable liquids or gases (that could
be busted by a tank intrusion), plus ignition sources, which no one can 
tell for sure were all off at the time.

On the contrary.  We are proposing alternate scenarios.  The people who

how the fire started, even though none of them were in a position to 
see it, either (and the stories they ""hear"" from their prisoners changes

but also wouldn't mind learning about others.  As I said, I can read
an intro-graduate level text book, having had some mathematics, though
not much number-theory per se.  I'd like to see the technical details
of the mathematics of cryptography, as oppossed to the popularizations
of things like _scientific am_ which just say, ""then you find a
*really* big prime number...."".

Following my request, several people were so kind as to suggest
reading-lists, which I hope to get around to.  Two other people were
so *very* kind as to send large documents, which I presume were actual
articles (about 1000 lines each); but I've stupidly deleted them
accidentally before having a chance even to skim them.  If they can
forgive me for my careless use of file-commands, would the original
senders be so kind as to resend? Or anyone else who has good
crypto-articles at a fairly technical mathematical level? Also,
ftp-able or gopher-able docs would be nice to know about.

My speculation does not include or depend upon a trapdoor in RSAREF. I
do not believe that RSA would consent to such.  

However, there are other limitation in the concept of RSAREF in which
NSA has an interest.  It has an interest in a limited number of
implementations, i.e., targets.  It has an interest in fixed key or
maximum modulus size.  

It has a legitimate (literally) right to pursue such interests.  Within
bounds, it probably has a right to pursue those interests by covert
means.  At least it has the same right as the rest of us not to disclose
all of its motives and intentions.  (Institutions are not self-aware;
they do not know their intentions in any meaningful sense.)

	Checker Motors went out of business in 1982.  It's hard to get
old Checkers that are worth restoring, since almost every one was
a fleet vehicle that was driven into the ground.  If you can get a

Checker used whatever parts were around.  For instance, I had a Chevy

	1987 ARIENS RIDING LAWN MOWER

	This mower is in perfect condition and
	contains the following features:

	- Electric Start
	- 26 inch cut
	- Double Rear Baggers
	- New Battery
	- New Engine (one year old)
	- Inflatable Tires (gives nice ride)
	- Cushioned Seat (gives nice ride)
	- Tuned up and blade sharpened in the
	  past month

	I am moving into a house that has a
	small area of grass to cut and does not
	require such large mower. The engine was
	replaced, not rebuilt, last year due to
	some faulty work done by a lawn mower
	repair shop.

Indeed.  Reading the cases of people who've tried the various things
Mr. Teel suggests show that defendants fall into two classes: (1) those
who win on procedural grounds or some grounds not related to their
claim, and (2) those who lose.

Consider Newman v. Schiff, 778 F.2d 460 (8th Cir.1985), which I've seen
cited by tax protestors other than Mr. Teel as a win for Mr. Schiff.
Mr. Schiff offered $100,000 on TV to anyone who would call in the
show and cite any section of the Internal Revenue Code that says that
an individual has to file a return.

Mr. Newman took him up on it.  Mr. Newman had seen the show in a rebroadcast
the next morning.  Mr. Schiff claimed that the offer only extended to
people who actually say the original broadcast, and so there was no offer
for Mr. Newman to accept, and so no unilateral contract was formed, and
so Mr. Schiff did not have to pay $100,000.

Mr. Schiff was correct, and so won.  So, yes, Mr. Schiff won against a
claim on the $100,000 reward.  However, his win had nothing to do with
the tax code.

        Thank you very much. These computers behave exactly like what

budgets, public education. How can I analyze this? All I need is some 
sort of packet counter. Do any exist, and where are they?

    Actually Judea and Samaria are proper geographical names, just like 
    Asia Minor or Lake Michigan. Judea and Samaria are even used in 
    an atlas published in (what used to be) USSR circa 1970 that I have at
    home. The government of the USSR was of course quite hostile towards
    Israel and would hardly engage in a pro-Israel propaganda. I would be
    willing to mail a photocopy of the relevant page to Mr. Schmidling

Mr. Schmidling is to be congtatualted for being living exception to this
general rule. For although he is almost without peer in both the number
of lies posted and in the number of times he repeats them --- he hasn't 
found many people who believe his lies (yet ?).

It stays alive as long as a program is actively running or as long as the mouse is moved.

Did anyone experience similar problems?
Any known fixes?

The gravity data is collected in real-time and it not recorded to the tape
recorder.  However, you only need to collect the gravity every 3rd or 4th
orbit, so there is no real data loss if the Moon blocks transmission for
a short while.

The aerobraking starts May 25 and is expected last about 70 days.  If the
funding is provided (8 million dollars) to extend the mission for the
high resolution gravity data, then the mission will last through October 1994.
Otherwise, the mission will end this coming July.

Andy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were 
each using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I
think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them,
though your usage is quite valid.

I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way
reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or 
describes things we can observe.

Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't
just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution
is still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started
because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,
basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a 
clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of
evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.

I'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger
about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_
proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves
are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not 
the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered 
fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle 
systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original 
point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only 
the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_
atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough
to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being 
any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.

The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:

   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)
      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational
        evidence (your way)

   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it
        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence

pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:

-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it

-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)
-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a

	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and

We have plenty of computer labs where the computers are left on all the
time. I don't see any shorter lifespan than the ones we have in the
offices which does get turned off at the end of the day. In fact, some
of the computers in the labs have outlived some of the same ones in the
offices. But it goes both ways so can't conclude anything.

If your Expose event handler is truly intelligent about exposed
rectangle information, then you can use XClearArea to generate an
Expose event (assuming that your background pixel is not None) for the
enclosing rectangle of your new item.

This is still not great, since any other items contained within that
rectangle will still be unnecessarily redrawn.

If your Expose event handler simply redraws everything, you'll be
doing much more work than just drawing the new item ""on top"" of the
existing scene.

In order to emit blue light, a semiconductor must have a band gap energy
within the region of 2.6 to 2.8 electron Volts. According to my physical
electronics prof, you can't get an LED with that band gap. That's why you
don't find blue LEDs or, for that matter, some other colour of LEDs. That
is not to say that blue LEDs can't be found.  I've seen 'blue' LEDs sold,
but they were just your typical visible light LED in a blue plastic covering.
They didn't emit very much light...

I am asking you to believe in things not visible. I don't know if this is
believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do
not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions
from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on
the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any
possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the
rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere
is not self explanatory). 

Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, 
which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence
is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The 
evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning
on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason
of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly
consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the
evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself
to us.

It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come
through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones
providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be
physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for
all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for
reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired
in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense,
belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.

>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if

>
Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source 
of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings
have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and
similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by
faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use
reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding
of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be
the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity
claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the
best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.

If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while
and you will see rational debate aplenty.

FYI:  The actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an HP
deskjet is 1/600th inch.  The electronics and dynamics of the ink
cartridge, however, limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch.
On almost any paper, the ink wicks more than 1/300th inch anyway.

The method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer
results in much less spread than ink drop technology.

It doesn't take much investigation to see that the mechanical and
electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than
inexpensive ink jet printers.  Recall also that laser printers
offer a much higher throughput:  10 ppm for a laser versus about 1
ppm for an ink jet printer.

Something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the
life of the printer.  A 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about
$US 75-80 at discount while HP high capacity (~500-1000 page yield)
cartridges are about $US 22 at discount.  It could be that over the
life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are
less than ink jet printers.  It is getting progressively closer
between the two technologies.  Laser printers are usually desinged
for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product
replacement cycles.

It depends on the mode you're using.  For a single 64-bit input block, a
one-bit error will have a 50 percent chance of corrupting each of the 64
output bits - in other words, it essentially turns the output block into
a random number.  If you're encrypting data in CBC mode, however, only the
one 64-bit block will be affected.  The next block, and all that follow it
will be decrypted properly.

It's a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if
corrupted bits are likely.

   Not necessarily.  I've been thinking about this, and if this chip/scheme
is to provide any real security, there must be some sort of key exchange,
either using a public-key encryption scheme, or using a key exchange scheme
like Diffie-Hellman.  If there's an out-of-band transmission of a shared
session key, then what protects that band from eavesdropping?  If the phone
company or some other online central authority generates a session key and
sends it to both users, then what's the point of going to the trouble of
having some complicated key-depositories?  Just ask the phone company for
a copy of the session key for each call.
 
   Now, it's probably not practical for each user to keep an online copy of
every public key used by anyone anywhere, right?  So, probably, there will
be some way of getting these keys verified.  This might be a digitally-
signed (by the chip manufacturer) copy of the public key in this unit,
stored by this unit.  It might also be an online directory with access to
everyone's public keys.  (This would introduce another weakness to the
security of the scheme, of course.)  Presumably, if you don't use your
designated key, you can't get a verified connection to other standard chips.
 
   It might be useful to have a modified chip, which would allow you to
use either the original public/private key pair, or some other key pair
and verification scheme.  Unfortunately, this would not allow you to call
most people and establish secure communications....

Just use a thin film of epoxy.  That!s what I did.  Epoxy conducts heat
fairly well.  And my heat sink gets warm to prove it.  I looked for the
stuff myself & my local EE jocks said to use epoxy.

Have fun.

So, it's okay to use civilians for cover if you're attacking soldiers
in your country.  (Of course, many of those attacking claim that they
aren't Lebanese, so it's not their country.)

Got it.  I think.  Hmm.  This is confusing.

Could you perhaps repeat your rules explaining exactly when it is
permissible to use civilians as shields?  Also please explain under
what conditions it is permissible for soldiers to defend themselves.
Also please explain the particular rules that make it okay for
terrorists to launch missiles from Lebanon against Israeli civilians,
but not okay for the Israelis to try to defend themselves against
those missiles.

Frankly, no.  Offense and defense are equally important.  But the
pitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player
is on offense.  Even shortstops are a bigger part of the offensive
game than of the defensive game.  (They might not do much with their
part of the offense, but that's another issue.)

That being said, I think both Smith and Yount deserve the HOF.  They
hit pretty well in addition to their defense.

I have seen a fair bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and
seizures.  I am also interested in this subject -- I have a son with
Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association.  I posted a
message like this a few months ago and received no replies, but here it
is again.

Is anyone interested in participating in a mailing list on Epilepsy and
seizures?  This would allow us to hold discussions and share
information via electronic mail.  I already run a Listserver for two
other groups, so the mechanics would be easy.

If you are interested, mail me a note.  If I get enough replies, I will
make it happen and provide you with the details.

BTW, I have also started a database on Epilepsy.  This is part of my
research on natural language question answering systems.  Users of this
service are able to ask questions about Epilepsy and the program
searches the database and retrieves its best response.  The technology
works by comparing your question against a set of questions that have
been seen before.  All new questions that are not answered are recorded
and used to improve the system.

This database is still small and sparse, but we are adding new
information.  To try it out, do the following

	telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca
	login: chat

	Then select the Epilepsy item from the menu of databases.

The only significant deposits of oil around Hamilton are those caused by
the tire fire a  few years back.

Then again if the NBA can have the Utah Jazz or the L.A. Lakers (think about

Hi everyone,

I thought that some people may be interested in my VR
software on these groups:

*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******

Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality
system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.

Features:

   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.
   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).
   Generic clients.
   Customizable servers.
   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).
   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).
   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily
        attached.

Functionality:

  Client:
   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things
   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's
   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's
   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to
   other users.

   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to
   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that
   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting
   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.

   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:

    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)

    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)

    o User Interface Panels

    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for
	faster frame rates)

    o Mouse and Keyboard Input

   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the
   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because
   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)

  Server(s):
   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is
   provided in this release for potential world server developers:

    o Transparent Client Management

    o Client Message Handling

   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of
accepting and
   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the
application writer
   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.

   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is
   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:

    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:
        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended
        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension
        initialisers you want.

    o Event Handler Registration:
        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback
        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.
        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)

    o Collision Detection Registration:
        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide
        some basic information to the collision detection management software.
        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.

    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because
    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects
    from which to choose.

    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:

    o Provide an initWorld function:
        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus
        any initialization you want to do.

    o Provide a positionObject function:
        This is where you determine where to place a new client.

    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:
        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.

    o Provide a getWorldType function:
        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.

    o Provide an animateWorld function:
        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects
        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit
        (to avoid outrunning the clients).

    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the
    three world servers I've provided:

        generic - 81 lines
        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the
                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future
                           versions)
        dogfight - 72 lines

Location:

   This software is located at the following site:
   ftp.u.washington.edu

   Directory:
   pub/virtual-worlds

   File:
   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z

Futures:

   Client:

    o Texture mapping.

    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading

    o HMD support.

    o Etc, etc....

   Server:

    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).

    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction

    o Etc, etc....

   Both:

    o Improved Comms!!!

I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse
software,
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure
whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(

I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of
the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I
would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

Finally one major disclaimer:

This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code
other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure
desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad
that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Disclaimer over!

Of course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with
POSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who
hates it: > /dev/null!

I may not be the world's greatest expert on chiggers (a type of
mite indigenous to the south), but I certainly have spent a lot
of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years
(since we moved to N.C.).  Here are some observations gained from
painful experience:

  1. Reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person.
     Some people get tiny red bites.  Others (like me) are more
     sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore-like affairs.

  2. Chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving.  I swear
     that these things will itch for months.

  3. There is a lot of folklore about chiggers.  I think most of
     it is fiction.  I have tried to do research on the critters,
     since they have such an effect on me.  The only book I could
     find on the subject was a *single* book in UNC's special
     collections library.  I have not yet gone through what is
     required to get it.

  4. Based on my experience and that of my family members, the old
     folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn't work.  I recall
     reading that the theory upon which it is based (that the chiggers
     burrow into your skin and continue to party there) is false.  I
     think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some
     sort the little pests release.  But this is speculation.

  5. The *best* approach is prevention.  A couple of things work well.
     A good insect repellent (DEET) such as Deep Woods Off liberally
     applied to ankles, waistband, etc. is a good start.  There is
     another preparation called ""Chig Away"" that is a combination of
     sulfur and some kind of cream (cortisone?) that originally was
     prepared for the Army and is not commercially available.  In
     the summer I put this on my ankles every morning when I get
     up on weekends since I literally can't go outside where we
     live (in the country) without serious consequences.  (They
     apparently don't like sulfur much at all.  You can use sulfur
     as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them.)

  6. No amount of prevention will be *completely* successful.  Forget
     the fingernail polish.  I have finally settled upon a treatment
     that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone
     creme (reduces the inflamation and swelling) and benzocaine
     (relieves the itch).  I won't tell you all the things I've tried.
     Nor will I tell you some of the things my wife does since this
     counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned (I also think
     it gains nothing).

  7. The swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved
     by the application of hot packs, and this seems to speed recovery
     as well.

Doctors seem not to care much about chiggers.  The urban and suburban
doctors apparently don't encounter them much.  And the rural doctors
seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure.  I
suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers
would make a *lot* of money.

This is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this, but never mind.
Any machine powered by heat (motor, steam- or gasturbine, steamengine,  
thermoelement,etc) work the better, the bigger the temperature difference  
between input and output is. Because You never get all thermic energy out of  
the powering medium (steam, burning gaz, etc), You have to eliminate the rest  
of the energy to keep the efficency high. A thermal electric power plant (coal,  
oil or atomic power) works just the same way. You heat water (steam) to power  
the turbine and generators. Because You don't get the whole energy out of the  
steam (efficency is never 100%) You have to cool down this steam again by  
something else. Most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose (some  
type of mega-refrigerator...). Others use water of a river (ecologically not  
unobjectionable). Got it ?

In my postings I have made a proposal for comments and discussion.
Those who don't want to discuss its merits and drawbacks are not forced to
do so.

However I would make anybody who incites others to harm me or harass
in a personal manner, legally responsible for their deeds. I cannot
accept and will not accept threats to my personal integrity and I
urge anybody who opposes terror to refrain from direct or indriect
threats.

PS: My proposal has nothing to do with Nazi eugenics. It has to do with
the search for peace which would enable justice. I don't consider that
justice is done, when non-Jews who fled or were expelled in 1948/1967
are not permitted to return to their homeland. This can at best be called
pragmatism, a nice word for legitimizing the rule of the strong. It can
never be called justice. And peace without justice will never be peace.
It is my conviction that the situation in which a state, through the
law, attempts to discourage mixed marriages (as Israel does), is not
normal. Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than
Western democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to
marry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have
drawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to
compensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy
endure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day
will come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,
in which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic
affiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any
more. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their
traditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state. Western
democracy clearly separates these domains and I am certain that
most
American Jews enjoy this fact and would not love to live in a state termed
Christian State and to have their Green cards stamped with a mark JEW.

I would ask those who are genuinely interested in an exchange of views
and personal experiencces to refrain from emotional, infantile
outbursts which might leed readers to infer that Jews who respect
Judaism are uncivilized. Such behaviour is not good for Judaism.

The thing is, I know what arms and legs are.  It's therefore generally easy to
tell whether or not someone has arms and legs.  This ""sinful nature"", since it
does not require that the baby actually perform any sins, seems to be totally
invisible.  As far as I know, maybe half the babies have a sinful nature and
half don't--it'd look exactly the same, since there is no way to tell the
difference.

So what's so bad about a sinful nature, then?  I could understand it being
bad if it always results in people committing sins, but babies can have it,
never commit sins, die, and they still have it.  So the bad part about can't
merely be that it results in people committing sins--so what _is_ bad about it?

I have a cheap solar charger that I keep in my car.  I purchased it via
some mail order catalog when the 4 year old battery in my Oldsmobile would
run down during Summer when I was riding my bike more than driving my car.
Knowing I'd be selling the car in a year or so, I purchased the charger.
Believe it or not, the thing worked.  The battery held a charge and
energetically started the car, many times after 4 or 5 weeks of just
sitting.

Eventually I had to purchase a new battery anyway because the Winter sun
wasn't strong enough due to its low angle.

I think I paid $29 or $30 for the charger.  There are more powerful, more
expensive ones, but I purchased the cheapest one I could find.

I've never used it on the bike because I have an E-Z Charger on it and
keep it plugged in all the time the bike is garaged.

Are the boards at all intelligent?  (I.e., run by microcontrollers?)  The
easiest thing would be to have another line that says that one of the
boards is talking to the PC.  When this line was true, the other boards
could all hold off and not send their data.  This isn't a perfect solution,
though, since you have to worry a little about making sure two boards don't
decide to talk at the _exact same time_.

Other than that, I think you will need to hook up each board to ""something""
that speaks RS-232.  This actually isn't as hard (or as expensive!) as it
used to be, though.  Assuming the boards talk relatively slowly (9600 BPS
or slower), the PICs can coordinate things between themselves to multiplex
the data.  (This is really just forbicly adding the suggestion in the first
paragraph to your system.  And it assumes that each board doesn't talk more
than 1/8th of the time, of for very long, since a PIC isn't going to be
able to buffer more than, maybe 20-some bytes!)

You might want to check into the prices of multi-serial card for your PC,
though.  I recently bought a Boca Research 2x4 card (2 parallel ports, 4
RS-232 ports) for a very reasonable $85.

You know, I was reading 18 U.S.C. 922 and something just did not make 
sence and I was wondering if someone could help me out.

Say U.S.C. 922 :

(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), it shall be unlawful for
any person to transfer or possess a machinegun.

 Well I got to looking in my law dictionary and I found that a ""person"" 
might also be an artificial entity that is created by government 
and has no rights under the federal constitution. So, what I 
don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on 
an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell
me what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law 
does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional
until it goes to court. So, has it ever gone to court, not
just your run of the mill ""Ok I had it I am guilty, put me in jail""

Has anyone ever claimed that they had a right to possess and was told
by the Supreme Court that they didn't have that right?

Nope.  I keep my Mac running all the time since it also acts as a
usenet node and exchanges mail and news every half hour (I run uAccess)
and receives all my faxes.

I do turn off the monitors hooked up to it.  They produce more heat
than I want - it can be warm in my garage office in the summer.  I've
got one of those handy power control centers ($25 at Fry's) to I just
flip the switch in front when I start or stop working.

By the way, this strategy seems to be somewhat endorsed by Apple since
their new Color Classic will turn off its own monitor after a certain
length of idle time.

In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, I think their
cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO
is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G
range.

>You can also assume that a working SSTO would have other applications

True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I
don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
risks involved.

If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures
100% of the available launch market, then I think you could
do it.

Of course it is.  It forms a very big part of your self-respect.  You come onto

I doubt that Sieferman has anything to do with you dropping out.  

It's probably closer to the truth to say that you don't have the cards to 
play in this game (because you insist on playing from a losing hand), and you're
finally realizing it.  You will lurk on the board, and keep 
quiet for a while, looking for an area where you are *certain* that you 
are correct, and then we'll see you pop back in again.  Of course, you then
will say that you have merely returned because your life is now ""in order"".

But we'll know better.

This was known as *Journey to the Far Side of the Sun* in the United
States and as *Doppelganger* in the U.K.  It was produced by the great
team of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (whose science was usually a bit
better than this).  It may have been their first production using live
actors-- they were better known for their technophilic puppet shows,
such as *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbirds*.  Later, they went
on to do more live-action SF series: *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.

The astronomy was lousy, but the lifting-body spacecraft, VTOL
airliners, and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to
look at.

This is a function of the weight, you have to be aggresive with the brake
squeze, actually as tested by Cycle world and an expert rider the ST
stopped faster then the comparable models from BMW, and YAMAHA even with 
the extra weight and Gas .

You must countersteer the ST for every turn and movement short
of the classic pothole wiggle. Just forget ever leaning into a 
turn again. It must be countersteered into every turn and then 
responds nicely.

Not true, the side stand is well designed for the weight and will hold 
the bike nicely on dirt. I am able to easily get the bike up on
the center stand, just step down on the stand instead of pulling
up on the bike.

Keep looking the 91 left overs if available are going for 72-7700.
I love mine and I haven't found a better value then the ST for 7500.

Excuse me to every one.
I am an Amiga owner and tired to have the same graphic modes.
So I saw on nn there was a little bridgeboard that made the
Amiga's PC slots communicate with the stanndard Amiga's slot.
The building mother house of this little gadget assure me
that using this thing I can use all the pc boards included
the SVGA cards.
I am interested in computer graphics and I do not know many
things about pc in general.
So, what is the best (ISA slot) card on the market ?
I'd like to reach resolutions like 1280x1024 with 256

Any suggestion ??

I have written the file manager HFM, wich has two windows which compare
the files in two directorys to find out wether there are equal or 
similar files. The 7 most important operations, copy, move, delete,
show the file, start a progam, navigate in the directory tree can be
invoked by dragging a directory entry with the mouse. This is very
convenient, because the selection of the file and the operation to
be performed, occur in one move. For bitmap graphic viewing the
program vpic can be integrated, for spreadsheat and database files
I use the view program from PCTOOLS 7.1. HFM can be configured to
use arbitrary viewers to show special data formats. It does
also present archives from pkzip etc. as simulated subdirectorys.
This filemanager has a somewhat non standart user interface, but
it is very convienient to use and is the prefered file manager 
in several labs in our university. 
The drawback of this filemanager is, it's still a dos program and
the development of a windows version has not yet begun. I use the
program package run18.zip, where run tells its windows companion
sched.exe which windows program should be started. In this way you
can start a windows program from a dosbox. The new version 3.19
(to be released soon) includes a new command for automating this
windows program start.

What's the feeling about eating and riding?  I went out riding this
weekend, and got a little carried away with some pecan pie.  The whole
ride back I felt sluggish.  I was certainly much more alert on the
ride in.  I'm sure others have the same feeling, but the strangest
thing is that eating is usually the turnaround point of weekend rides.

From now on, a little snack will do.  I'd much rather have a get that

Often Shuttle lifts satellites with upper stages. Yet we still consider it
payload. Ten Saturn flights over about 4 years delivered to LEO roughly the
same as 50 shuttle flights over 10 years.

They where pretty much the same in terms of cost/pound. A resurected
Saturn would cost only $2,000 per pound (if development costs are ignored)
which is five times cheaper than Shuttle.

 Dennis Deconcini, 1982
 
...In these and similar areas, the
Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5
U.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent ""secret lawmaking"" by
administrative bodies.
   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-
committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded
rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United
States.
   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise
of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.
   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-
ing and seizing private property.
   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property
without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-
out regard for their right to due process of law.
   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was
utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the
Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities
were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-
gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to
be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently
made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-
tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before
BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence
was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF
gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither
criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into
unknowning technical violations.

Letter to Constituent: April 1993
 
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with
jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.
 
It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which
funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly
professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.
The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in
successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use
of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It
enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory
minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an
illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in
preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk
youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known
gangs from access to weapons.
 
The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF
on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession
(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs
and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to
trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where
they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF
is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with
state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state
and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office
felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally
establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and
thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members
of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a
Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would
be separated from the women and children and not in the area where
it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.
 
As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh
spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending
execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the
element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and
prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation
presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the
FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military
tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and
firepower of the Branch Davidians.
 
Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian
raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply
saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who
attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the
cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a
thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside
the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for
Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the
Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the
evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick
and peaceful conclusion.
 
Sincerely,
 
Dennis DeConcini
Chairman
Subcommittee on Treasury,
Postal Service and
General Government

I hate to belabor the obvious once again, but if there had been an Orbiter
emergency in the early stages of the original HST deployment mission, they
would have HAD to land with HST in the bay. 

Indeed they were worried about that.  One concern was the possibility that
they would lose a motor or something on the way up, and make orbit but one
that was too low to give HST a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag.  
I believe the decision was to deploy HST even if the projected lifetime was
as short as six months.  In fact we got an excellent orbit, on the upper
envelope of what the Shuttle can do.

I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought 
down for refurbishment.  You would have the horrendous cost of transporting,
cleaning, re-testing, and re-certifying all the hardware on the ground, in
addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment 
mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second 
time.  And, you would probably STILL need a (third) servicing mission in a 
few years as gyros and other components wear out.  Better to have two 
servicing missions in space (which could well happen) than to bring HST down 
and take it up again.

W4WG requires DOS drives.  I use LASTDRIVE=J which makes my first Novell drive
K and leaves me drives G, H, I and J for W4WG.  My local DOS drives use A-F.

As a followup to my post let me add that:

I'm not really a Windows or Windows NT user, so please excuse my ignorance.
However, I'm a developer at SAS Institute, and one component of the
application that I support is the ability to submit a (SAS) batch job from
within an interactive SAS session.  The user site can enter their
site-specific ""batch profile"" into a dataset within our product, specifying
the pathname to the SAS executable, specifying site specific SAS options,
etc.  At run time certain variables are resolved, and the resolved file is
written to an external ascii file.  Then I exit to the operating system and
run the job asynchronously, returning to the interactive session as soon as
the job is submitted.  The batch job then runs concurrently with the
interactive session.

As currently designed, the internal dataset has a record length of 80
characters.  But, to run the batch job, the command to reinvoke SAS in
batch mode requires more than 80 characters.  Up til NT this has not been a
problem, since every job control/shell language up til NT (eg.
MVS/CMS/VMS/UNIX/OS2) had a way to escape the CR/LF and enter a single
command across multiple lines (OS/2 via their REXX language, which is
*STANDARD* with OS/2).

The gist of all this is, since this application is for end-users, not
within my company, I have to try to develop this process using native NT.
Since my first posting I've learned that there are several third party
companies that provide alternative script languages for Windows/Windows NT.
And I'm sure a company that licenses our product would use that alternative
script language if they had it, but I can't develop under the assumption
that they have anything other than what comes with NT.

I saw another post on this list (the subject was something like ""Is vi
available for Windows?"") in which someone said that vi, make, awk, and
***ksh*** was available with Microsoft TOOLKIT.  What is that product?  Is
it a separate product or part of Windows?  ksh would do what I need if I
could count on it at all NT sites.

One last question:  I've heard that NT has remote processing capabilities,
i.e. I could shove this batch job off to a server machine and have it run
there.  If these are native NT commands rather than network specific
commands, this would also help me improve this process.  If you can comment
on these commands, I would appreciate it.

Thanks again for the help,

The first means that some aspect of reality contains objective values.
The second means that values are a reference to some preference of the
individual.  In the first case, it is possible that some future discovery
might invalidate certain views re what objective values are.

   Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say,
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve
those for c.s.m.a :-) )

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a
booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture
using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
(1.5).

   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite
nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by
3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he
increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know
what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.

   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was
from memory!

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some
hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the 
animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?

   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.

   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can
claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in 
my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer
low-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it, 
no longer CD-I.

Hello, I'm back..

I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be
it a positive or negative one). I read EVERY letter and thought about 
each one!! 

I got all sorts of responses, from ""marry her"" to ""have nothing ever to 
do with her again""

Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have
decided to do.

I sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious
about moving away from home to another state that ""I would do anything to 
get you here in NC."" I told her that I tried to find out if there were 
any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.

About her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause
I still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said
that ""Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)""

Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.

Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I 
have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If
she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it
yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian.
It just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure
that if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10 
years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it
will happen!

She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to 
see her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know
more of what to look forward to.

I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell
my folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.

I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation
in your prayers..

Finally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...

If you have anything else for me...I will be at this email address
for one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curious
how folks think about what i did.


Thanx

It also falls within the purview of the ACLU, but that doesn't mean
the ACLU (or the EFF) would be the most effective instrument to 
""win the hearts and minds"" in favor of access to cryptography. 

It's precisely slogans like ""cryptography makes censorship impossible""
which stand to torpedo any attempt to generate a broad consensus in favor
of encryption.  It is not true, and in the context of a public debate it
would be a dangerous red herring.  Advocates of strong crypto had better
prepare themselves to answer such charges in pragmatic terms that laypeople
and politicians can sympathize with. The usual mumblings about
Constitutional amendments are not enough.

Seems to me that the driver was driving the vehicle visually impaired.
Isn't that like not scraping ice and snow off your windshield and such?

Say, that's another thing that bugs me.  Why don't people scrape their
damn windows?  I've seen people driving cars with *barely* the driver's
half of the windshield cleared.  Nothing else cleared.  This seems
pretty stupid and isn't there something (probably varies state to state)
that says a certain percentage of the glass must be clear?  Oh, well.

Jim,

I think you must have come in late. The discussion (on my part at
least) began with Benedikt's questioning of the historical acuuracy of
the NT. I was making the point that, if the same standards are used to
validate secular history that are used here to discredit NT history,
then virtually nothing is known of the first century.

You seem to be saying that the Bible -cannot- be true because it
speaks of the existence of God as it it were a fact. Your objection
has nothing to do with history, it is merely another statement of
atheism.

University of California Press (Berkeley and Los Angeles), 1967, p. 13.

""The addition of the Kars and Batum oblasts to the Empire increased the
 area of Transcaucasia to over 130,000 square miles. The estimated population
 of the entire region in 1886 was 4,700,000, of whom 940,000 (20 percent) were
 Armenian, 1,200,000 (25 percent) Georgian, and 2,220,000 (45 percent) Moslem.
 Of the latter group, 1,140,000 were Tatars. Paradoxically, barely one-third
 of Transcaucasia's Armenians lived in the Erevan guberniia, where the 
 Christians constituted a majority in only three of the seven uezds. Erevan
 uezd, the administrative center of the province, had only 44,000 Armenians
 as compared to 68,000 Moslems. By the time of the Russian Census of 1897,
 however, the Armenians had established a scant majority, 53 percent, in the
 guberniia; it had risen by 1916 to 60 percent, or 670,000 of the 1,120,000
 inhabitants. This impressive change in the province's ethnic character 
 notwithstanding, there was, on the eve of the creation of the Armenian 
 Republic, a solid block of 370,000 Tartars who continued to dominate the 
 southern districts, from the outskirts of Ereven to the border of Persia."" 
 (See also Map 1. Historic Armenia and Map 4. Administrative subdivisions of 
 Transcaucasia).

In 1920, '0' percent Turk. 

""We closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as 
 ways of escape for the Tartars and then proceeded in the work 
 of extermination. Our troops surrounded village after village. 
 Little resistance was offered. Our artillery knocked the huts 
 into heaps of stone and dust and when the villages became untenable 
 and inhabitants fled from them into fields, bullets and bayonets 
 completed the work. Some of the Tartars escaped of course. They 
 found refuge in the mountains or succeeded in crossing the border 
 into Turkey. The rest were killed. And so it is that the whole 
 length of the borderland of Russian Armenia from Nakhitchevan to 
 Akhalkalaki from the hot plains of Ararat to the cold mountain 
 plateau of the North were dotted with mute mournful ruins of 
 Tartar villages. They are quiet now, those villages, except for 
 howling of wolves and jackals that visit them to paw over the 
 scattered bones of the dead.""

No kidding. The Armenians tore apart the Ottoman Empire's eastern provinces,
massacred 2.5 million defenseless Turkish women, children and elderly 
people, burned thousands of Turkish and Kurdish villages and exterminated 
the entire Turkish population of the Armenian dictatorship between 
1914-1920. Such outrageous sleight of hand that is still employed today 
in Armenia brings a depth and verification to the Turkish genocide 
that is hard to match. A hundred years ago Armenians again thought 
they could get whatever they wanted through sheer terror like the 
Russian anarchists that they accepted as role models. Several Armenian 
terror groups like ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle 
resorted to the same tactics in the 1980s, butchering scores of innocent
Turks and their families in the United States and Europe. It seems that 
they are doing it again, at a different scale, in fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
today.

A merciless massacre of the civilian population of the small Azeri 
town of Khojali (Pop. 6000) in Karabagh, Azerbaijan, is reported to 
have taken place on the night of Feb. 28 under a coordinated military 
operation of the 366th mechanized division of the CIS army and the 
Armenian insurgents. Close to 1000 people are reported to have been 
massacred. Elderly and children were not spared. Many were badly beaten 
and shot at close range. A sense of rage and helplessness has overwhelmed 
the Azeri population in face of the well armed and equipped Armenian 
insurgency. The neighboring Azeri city of Aghdam outside of the
Karabagh region has come under heavy Armenian artillery shelling. City 
hospital was hit and two pregnant women as well as a new born infant 
were killed. Azerbaijan is appealing to the international community to 
condemn such barbaric and ruthless attacks on its population and its 
sovereignty.

Not if you've scored four runs, you don't!  Why strain even the best pitching
staff?  Why not make it easier for them?  

In the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate
for a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the 
wrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot 
yourself are insurance against the ""Shit happens"" aspect of baseball.

Not every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of
the 70's was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench-
Perez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.

I was wrong! I guess they are closer to $800 new! I will
probably still sell them for the above implied $300 obo.
Email me if you want more specifics. This is a really

Sell the bike and the car and start taking the bus. That way you can
keep drinking which seems to be where your priorities lay.

I expect that enough of us on this list have lost friends because of
driving drunks that our collective sympathy will be somewhat muted.

How do you know it's based on ignorance, couldn't that be wrong? Why would it
be wrong 
to fall into the trap that you mentioned? 

Also, if I may, what the heck where we talking about and why didn't I keep

DEC does this only for their PX and PXG servers, known as 3D accelerators.
This boards have local offscreen memory which is limited and slow to
handle, thus they set this limit.
