nazi the degree program near eastern studies and has organized the program for the study and turkish with the center for near eastern studies how did you come write these two books turkey and european and turkish jews basically but also jewish ive spent five years history and time went along found the jews them but never did anything with them until couple years ago when that was the the jews being from and coming turkey then the down avenue give series three these were greatly appreciated and further research develop book the jews the and the turkish this book quite different from the works most jewish who look the jews any country more from the the jews and the jewish community and jewish sources view subject and approach the jews the from the point view society using sources after this book and sent the press came across additional documents turkish jews during world war the completed book had said that turkey had done good deal the jews during world war but did not actually have many details then found batch documents the foreign archive actions taken turkish help the jews before and during the holocaust was too late add this new information the book press decided write second book further research the archives the foreign and the turkish and the result was the second book turkey and the holocaust which details how turkey jews from the nazis how exactly did they this the story takes place over number years the book the material three parts first which with the period before the holocaust when the nazis came power germany they immediately started jews and anti nazi germans from scientific and the like turkey that moment was just beginning the process its and saw these jews who were being from their germany good source new help the turkish within three months after the nazis started these jews turkey take many them they were brought turkey and were given the turkish scientific and medical about major jewish came turkey the german political spent the war years political science turkey after world war was during the major german jewish came turkey and establish modern school man who was from the nazis turkey and spent the war years turkey eventually came where other german jewish activities turkey one such was who had been leading until was the nazis went turkey where organized the turkish national and the turkish national company with the help paul the first section the book covers this first when jews were being germany and turkey enough the german when they were turkey did not seem think too germany they themselves more germans than jews and they did not the anti nazi activities the local turkish jewish community even found letters from the nazi representatives turkey these german jewish for their work the idea german culture even though these people had been the nazis and the turks they shared the nazis over the turks the second part the book with the holocaust which began when the nazis occupied france europe that time and especially france there were about turkish jews they had europe for various reasons from about the turn the century most them had europe during the turkish war for after world war when was turkey the had the jews throughout the century and the jews what might happen them the took over turkey many jews france during the and many also their turkish and french citizens the nazis france and started all anti jewish laws the turkish jews soon found that was not worth very much french but that was worth lot turkish how turkey through most world war its and all the nazi occupied countries until finally the war the side the the end during the war therefore turkey was position defend its citizens against anti jewish and the actions that turkish took form the second chapter the book turkish who were france particular protect jews turkish from the nazis for those turkish jews who had their turkish there was generally problem they were and sent the turkish would with the the and other and say effect these people are turkish citizens you cant this them and the turkish jews would released their were the turkish would and the would the nazis general wanted keep the turkey they able use turkey gateway for the middle east and they also wanted obtain and from turkey order keep turkish they usually accepted these turkish jews the turkish sometimes went the secure the release turkish jews times they even turkish jews for extermination and getting them off the most the foreign jews were sent place called and thats where most the turkish took place the greater problem came with the turkish jews who had their turkish and had become french citizens the couldnt that these people were turkish citizens because they were not book includes jews front the turkish either get return turkey get their turkish this was matter the application would take some time the was real because the nazis would jews the for almost nothing the nazis would even them they had their because and were jews take care these former turkish jews the turkish document called fellow the document said effect this person former turkish who has applied for the his turkish the would appreciate you would treat him were turkish the wrote the document turkish and put their since the nazis could not read turkish the whole they accepted these this means the turkish were able many jews who had their turkish actually the nazis were two about the turkish defense jews the one hand the nazi foreign which wanted the turkey was favor accepting these the other hand and wanted all jews times and were able and some the turkish jews were sent off before the turkish could anything you have statistics how many turkish jews were there were about turkish jews europe before world war about whom were living france most the information this section the book the situation france have published the letters that the turkish sent the nazi and the letters that came back reply generally the nazis said that the turkish would present documents that individuals are turkish citizens and send them out france the nazis would release them from the the turkish also organized special take turkish jews from nazi occupied territory back turkey these ran and the nazis gave the turkish jews they could pass out nazi territory but the were often held the nazi governments eastern europe and because these governments really didnt want the jews escape result the turkish efforts about the turkish jews france were another were sent off where most them died the remaining either across the border into the area southern france occupied the who jews much better than the nazis did the end however fell out the war and that was the end for those jews well the turkish nazi occupied also worked jews that country the second part your book then with turkish jews turkish turkish from nazi yes and there might add here their turkish jews the turks their with germany which stated that turkish citizens german territory would the same german citizens turkey that basis the turks that the nazis could not against turkish citizens who are jews the nazis claimed and the government agreed that they were not because they were all jews turkey saying you are our citizens according religion but the turkish constitution requires that all citizens regardless religion therefore you cannot single out turkish jews american accepted the nazi argument and told american jews who were being the nazis that they couldnt anything about because the american jews were being the same other jews the third part the book takes place turkey which was the center during the holocaust for activities the eastern european jews the agency organization jews help jews set office under the other jewish organizations especially the also sent representatives set these groups first tried contact jews eastern europe find out what was happening today know about the holocaust but that time people didnt know what was going they didnt imagine the nazis could the things they were doing and the first step was get information and the turkish government let them use the turkish send letters their and friends eastern europe the jewish organizations found out what was happening when they received later when the nazis began such letters the jews received assistance also from the who served the from and later pope john the during the war used the the catholic church what the turkish government was doing jewish agencies jews eastern europe with the cooperation the turkish government these agencies then sent hard food and even and jews and they werent able help much because then the nazis had out almost all the jews possible the agencies for the jews get out eastern europe either through the called express through the black turkey was not for all these remain within its during the war because was being and was terrible food and the government therefore the the non turkish jewish from turkey either the express through the and small across the eastern from southern turkey these efforts were opposed not only the nazis but also the british who did not want any more jewish because they would hurt their relations with the arabs the british the turkish government stop this traffic and send those jews back few cases the turkish government british pressure did send the back for example one the with some jewish from was sent back the turkish government result the the british when that was soviet all were lost except one person all told the turkish government allowed than eastern european jews pass through turkish territory and move during the second world war the turkish authorities also provided these with and money and gave them send money and food out the country many these jews who passed through turkey may still living israel yes and their children but lets return for moment the first group the turkish jews who came from europe they did not they stayed turkey was the non turkish eastern european jews who passed through turkey their story very interesting and you have from many studies have been made the holocaust but most them not the eastern european middle eastern jews most the has the western european jews whom million were the nazis study with much number people have tried round out the picture and hope book will other further the history eastern jews when comes numbers the german jews were also relatively small number most the millions were jews the eastern european jews may not seem significant compared with the total million who were murdered but meant lot those who were about three the book documents many documents they are included because the story not well known not only are people the west the actions the turkish even the people turkey did not know the story felt that they would not fully understand this unless they could see the documents what languages are used the documents most them are turkish french some are there great deal material about the organization the going the and but did not into those details describe mostly what turkey did most documents are turkish french few documents are english the jewish groups did not necessarily with one another jews fact they often with one another they took turns trying get the turkish government groups for example some the groups felt that the jewish agency was run western european jews who were interested only western european jews finally president sent personal who had been department store new york city and managed their the documents related his mission are english also many documents from holocaust france who worked the french jews his was killed the nazis gave had the german archives the turkish jews didnt personally the german archives believe that much more can learned from the german archives and hope someone will make the effort this new book well with your doesnt right giving course the history the jews the first gave the course two years ago addition research writing and ive been actively

from the white house subject clinton press conference organization mit artificial intelligence lab lines nntp posting host the white house office the press for release april press conference the president the east room the president you have question president theres feeling that the western response bosnia has been holocaust asked you yesterday something anything stop the fighting the united states considering taking action such air against sites the president well first let say you know for more than week now have been seriously our options for further action and want say too lets look the last three months since president have worked with our and have tried move forward first the enforcement the the war crimes investigation getting the involved the peace process have made some and now have very much resolution and who the national security the president europe now working that that going make big difference and are other options think should act should lead the united states should lead have led for the last three months have moved the and fair our europe have been willing their part and they have troops the ground there but not think should act alone nor think will have and the next several days think will the review which has been going and which has taken lot time well the time the administration should have over the last days think well that the near future and then well have policy and well and everybody can can follow the president sure you see any parallel between the ethnic bosnia and the holocaust the president think the holocaust whole different level think without human history the other hand ethnic the kind that the holocaust took the degree the idea moving people around and them and often killing them because their thing and especially that area where people different ethnic groups live side side for long together and think you have stand against think its wrong were talking today about all the other that region was happy see the violence between the and the bosnia this morning and think were making that front but whats going with the and the ethnic different than the other both within the former and other parts the region president any count you have not had good week your the waco the your bill the bosnia what did you wrong and what are you going how you look things are you the president dont really believe that the situation bosnia its not been good week for the world but dont know that the administration could have made different the package like put into the larger context and you that this days have already changed the direction american government have down the that brought the this country from only the plan which passed the congress which will reduce the and increase has led year low rates lower interest rates there are probably people this room who have their home the last three months who have had access cheaper credit thats going put billion dollars throughout this economy ways that are very very good for the country and are moving the right direction that the did not pass and have ask and will continue ask not only people the administration but people the congress whether there something could have done pass that part the reason didnt pass was politics part was difference ideas there are really people still who believe that its not needed just disagree with that think the the say its been for about two years and still had months seven percent and all the countries are having trouble think there was idea base argument there that while were waiting for the lower interest rates and the and the the next four years take effect this sort should forward now have tell you did that because majority the now the for similar when was president and times for regular like this just and hope that can learn something ive just been here days and you know was working with for years and took get political there takes time change things but basically feel very good about whats happened the first days with regard the congress waco the president well with regard waco dont have much add what ive already said think want the situation looked into want bring people who have any bear that think its very important that the whole thing gone over but still maintain what said from the beginning that the there was david koresh and not think the united states government responsible for the fact that bunch decided kill themselves and sorry that they killed their children president follow your package and your political approach hill said today that youre playing games with the american people your tax policy was strongly your package said hes going launch against the north american free trade how are you going handle his political criticism will your efforts the hill with your economic plan and you plan some the things that have been your program and try them the hill the president let answer that question first were going all that over the next few days going talking members congress and others see what can about that with regard the economic plan must say found that rather amazing dont want get into argument with ill interested hear what his are but would back and read his book and his plan theres except that have more specific taxes less the middle class and more the but otherwise the plans are similar think would ill interested see maybe perhaps hes changed his position from his book last year and has some new ideas bring bear ill glad hear them follow how you plan handle his political criticism hes against you you think you can sit back and just the president well first all will ask you apply the same level him you and hes changed his position from the took the last year then need know why and what his ideas are maybe hes got some ideas think the american people have shown that theyre very with people who dont want produce results and the one thing think that everybody has figured out about the last even they dont agree with what that want get something done just came here try change things want things and want things that help peoples lives that makes suggestion that good that that takes beyond some idea ive proposed that will change peoples lives for the better fine but think that that the test that apply everyone who into this debate and not just the president president back bosnia for minute you continue that this has action that seems have when comes many options thus far and makes look this state the united states the last remaining why not appropriate this situation for the united states act the president well the united states surely you would agree that the united states even the last remaining has act with international law under some the united nations but you have and the president they and that one the things that have under review havent out any option for action would all you have not out any option except that have not discussed and are not considering the american into there are not are other options but also would you that fair our have had the french the british and the have had troops the ground there they have been worried about those but they have supported the the the they the american now europe working how make these really work and really against and can tell you that the other nations involved are also their position and would not rule out the fact that can reach for action that goes beyond where have been dont have any criticism the british the french and others about that would that military action president several the leading your administration from your fbi your your your health services have statements the last couple weeks which are absolutely some the youve taken your administration why that are you losing your political the president give example example judge said that there was child abuse waco has said this least that she air bosnia all these are things you said that you didnt support the president first all dont know what know that david koresh had sex with children think that not not does anybody dispute that where come from that child abuse and know that had people these how kill themselves think that abuse and not judge because dont know exactly what said terms has made public statement all about air there press report that she wrote letter which she expressed her which she expressed her views about the new direction should take response request all the members administration let know what they thought next and have heard from her and from others about what they think next and not going discuss the they made but the next few days when make decision about what then will what going wouldnt say that either one those speaking out school how about the value added tax president the president what was that the value added tax and miss both said that they thought that that was good idea the president dont mind them saying they think its good idea there are all arguments for policy that does not mean that have decided the health care debate decision has been made that and have their their views that had lot people from business and come saying that they thought that tax would help make their particular more the economy took that wasnt taking line against administration policy president week ago group and representatives came out with you and expressed the most terms their your understanding them and their political and their belief that you would those you feel now that you will able their now the president well dont know about that and dont know what their depends what the are but ill tell you this believe that this should biased favor believe when you tell people they cant certain things this country that other people can there and reason for believe need the services all our people and have said that and not political the first time this issue came was when was boston was just asked the question about and might add its interesting that have been obviously those who disagree with here are primarily coming from the political right america when was was from the other direction for for the rights religious run their child care and practice home under appropriate just have always had almost view that should try protect the rights american individual citizens live the their and going right with that are you concerned that you may have generated their end and criticism among others that has your administration the sense far too great this issue the president yes but have not great deal its gotten lot other and the press ive just simply taken position and tried see through and thats what doesnt take lot time president say what believe and what and thats what ill continue president getting back the situation bosnia and understand you havent made any final new options previously considered but the two most heard options would the arms the defend themselves and some limited air perhaps cut off supply lines without telling your decision presumably you havent made any final those two options what are the and that are going through your mind right now and will your final decision the president get into this there are those are two the options there are some other options that have been considered all have and all have and within the administration and the congress where would you heavy will required any new policy believe that the air issue the that general has made generally about military action apply there you take action the united states takes action must have clearly defined that can met must able understand and its must clear the united states not should not become involved war with regard the the arms the question obviously there you the people fight will that help get and bring about peace will lead more what kind reaction can others have that would the the policy but think both them deserve some serious consideration along with some other options have you think that these people who are trying get into war bosnia are really that havent taken care thousands from the last war and couldnt take care our and get them all home from and now many them are coming with for treatment how can afford any more these the president well think thats good argument against the united states itself becoming involved war there but are after all the worlds only power have lead the world and there very serious problem ethnic the former which could have not only further and knows there have been many but also could have other practical other where the same ethnic exist did you make any kind with hold off either air any kind action against the until after sunday and general how has his political situation your bosnia the president have not made any and did not ask for that never even discussed that enough the would you the middle president from our attempt get through the united nations what thought was the proper decision for them and one that the united states and sure the rest the free world very much appreciated you wish president that youd become more involved the planning the waco operation and how would you handle that situation now the president dont think practical matter that the president should become involved the planning those things that one the things that sure will come out when look into this the questions will asked and answered did all who the line command ask the questions should have asked and get the answers should have gotten and look forward that but the time have say did before the first thing did after the atf agents were killed once knew that the fbi was going was ask that the military because the least military nature the conflict given the resources that koresh had his compound and their obvious use them and then the day before the action asked the questions the general which have reported you previously and which the time thought were have said sure leave others make the suggestions about whether there are other questions should have asked president what your role the waco and have you made decision his future and you havent will you give him personal before you decide the president well first all have his role since had direct contact with him and mean negative positive have there stand what said before about general high regard for the fbi and waiting for from the general about what with the direction the fbi president since you said that one side bosnia conflict represents that the holocaust carried the degree why you then tell that the united states cannot take view this war the president well said that the ethnic something stand against that does not mean that the united states the united nations can enter war effect the lines lines within what was that that would successful think what the united states has try figure out whether there some way with the people their own can stand and stop ethnic and that obviously the are with this clearly the most difficult foreign policy problem face and that all our face and were easy suppose would have been before have tried more the last days than was previously done has clearly not been enough stop the and are now looking what else can yesterday you specifically the administration for not having the the and things that were near military arent there like that that would not conflict direct conflict that you might consider the president there may would you that the were somewhat different were then war with germany the time and thats what made that whole series but have say got all our options under review the the what can you short full scale military operation the president well you may know something dont thats not what our people tell think and have done together good job the thing keeps going back and because the people who are involved with the government there its obvious what their are they were the same that led the the first place and president feel should power were working toward that get report that discuss least three times week and that were going there and successful believe that theres every reason think that there will have some sort try the security and the freedom from violence people both the while try establish the conditions society but believe were going there president would you care make your the first days before make one for you the president well ill say believe first all passed the resolution record time that was the issue that the direction the administration and the the that could both bring the down and increase and that could specific and taxes almost all which come from the income people this society year which most the tax were the middle class whose were going down when their taxes were going while the went from the total national and the have year low interest rates from have lower interest rates across the board have dollars back into this economy people their have new policy which different the education has worked with and with others and with the establish new approach education that standards well opportunity have done amount work political and and have own these things are with not only what said the but with the country around the president task force which will change the way the federal government and make much more the citizens this country are working whole range other things the move people from work and course massive amount work has been done the health care issue which huge economic and personal security problem for millions americans think amazing how much has been done more will done also passed the family leave bill version the motor bill that has not come out conference back yet and everything has been passed except the program think were doing fine and were moving the right direction feel good about follow wouldnt you say though that one your aid soviet russia now cant pass bill our own country how can for them the president let the question little bit its good question its good question but fair got have already the first round aid the soviet non soviet russia russia going through the first billion the aid that agreed with our the provide through the international which big going through the question can get any more aid for russia that requires new the united states congress and that question think mary that will the weeks part what happens the american and their and their future think the two things will many members congress the report came out this morning and nearly criminal the part the how much did you discuss the and what might done about with your the the the president first let comment little that the report details which wrong and which has place the armed services and expect the report the appropriate way also want say the american people and all you that the report should taken for what very list which will have should not taken general the united states all the fine people who serve there very specific its and will the only thing said the the and the only thing should have said him think that expected him take the report and his duty and believe will that president back russia for just minute the show that will probably win his vote but there seems real whether not are going his economic the president understand that can you live with can you live with decision though you need both passed order then build support for russian aid the president believe the answer your question for the united states the key question should that which any which who wins the wins the the russian people continue their president then think should our best work with him toward you know had lot other countries here for the holocaust museum their leaders were here leaders from eastern europe leaders from least one the former soviet all them having terrible economic they convert from command and control economy market economy world where theres economic and world which theres economic and all leaders will have trouble having their popular because they havent produced the results that the people for you can understand that but they have the think thats all can ask and the united states will the russian people him their president and with him then the united states will continue work with him think small and committed think that should support that president has come out strongly what behind the line against free trade how hard are you going fight for this free trade and when you expect see the president think well have the the fairly near future you know our people are still working with the government and with the the side were trying work out what the will say what the will say and then what the way deal with enforcement the say and there some their position that theyre worried about their enforcement even the united states fair have some folks who are worried about that about giving that the other hand were going have and standards that means something then there has some for them what were trying agree approach which would say that there you keep past certain point maybe not but there going some enforcement there must and were working out the details that but still feel quite good about and this just area where disagree with and with others think that will win big have fair that more the economy and the american economy and leads from there other market america and gives bigger world which trade think thats the only way rich country can you look what japan and other countries the are doing reach out their own region its pretty good that had better about how build those our own area this idea battle you know youve got lot questions and want answer them all but let say not every one these things can simply into politics you know whos for this and whos for that and this person for this somebody else has got for that lot these things honestly involved real over ideas over whos right and wrong about the world toward which were moving and the answers are not self and one the reasons that wanted run for president wanted sort open the for these ideas that could try change the appropriate way just have difference opinion believe that the concept sound even though you know thought that the details needed president there was interest earlier this month the russian document that show that the had held back american general has now said that while the document itself was that was you have personal view this point about that issue and more you believe that fact the did return all the american the time the peace the president first let say saw general before went and after returned and have high regard for him and appreciate his serve his country this way whether the document had any basis fact let say that the government was more than had been the past and gave some documents that would the the russian documents claim not know whether that right wrong are having basically this time and when complete the well tell you and course want tell the those who were action who were think that well able make some some the questions about the cases result this last but cannot say that fully that know all that need know there are still some cases that dont know the answer but believe were making some was the last like follow that before the relations allows trade forward you have personally sure that every case has been would you willing forward the basis that while may take years these cases the have made good faith the president lot say you can never every case every one that couldnt all the cases for them and that there are still some cases that have not been going back the second world war but what would have that had gone long way toward every case that could this moment time and that there was complete open and continue everything that could done always keep those cases and were not there yet again have little bit people who know lot about this and being much more the the people whose lives were lost there whose lives remain question than the commercial interest and the other things which seem this moment just very how the feel your economic package are you doing some kind reality check now and back some your plans your plans for the coming year including the crime bill the health care and other things are there any plans that and also did you the power bob the president what was the which what thought was fairly self case particularly after stayed below the this congress including the who were this congress last year when had already passed resolution which called for over billion when they had for help foreign governments thought least four them would vote break and that did not have with that also thought that made good faith effort and that would not instead every time something they reduced the offer that they had previously been talking the majority leader about was strange set events but think what happened was what was significant part our plan but not the major part political that got out the that lot were saying president like for this but cant now and were all out and were and think need reality check said what want know let back what said what want know from our folks and from our friends the and what could have done make come out because the real here were not the president and the administration the real were the thousands people who wont have now could have put another work this summer mean could have done lot good things with that money and think that very very and more political than should have but the underlying dont think lot water that was that just wont and the president mean you know for example you mentioned the crime bill think would real mistake not pass the crime bill mean the crime bill was almost the point last year and they were all fighting over the bill surely surely after what have been through this country just the last three months with the kind violence have seen can pass bill requiring people through waiting period before they buy and surely can see that need more police officers the street thats another thing that really believe that once move some that money not all but some into this package make some the police officers the street been off that would case mean people are this country and think need forward feel very strongly that need forward the crime bill president back the report for second that report contained very strong criticism the general but did not name any the officers you believe that the officers who are this including who was there one night should they and you believe the public has right know the names the officers the president you should know that under the law which apply this the command there now report and the law must take its course were answer that question might any which might later made this case dont really think think all can tell you what have already said was very the specific the report and want appropriate action taken until the proper have chance and appropriate action taken have been that because the have very about what say not the rights anybody against whom any action might the case any other way either pro cant say any more except say that want this thing appropriate and way president could ask you for bosnia you said that you were not considering american does that include any air well ground the president said ground you said ground could ask you you fear that using air might draw the united states into ground war there the president just dont want discuss our the options anymore ive told you that theres never been serious discussion this country about the ground into conflict there with thousands washington this for the did you ever your decision leave town for this did you ever consider any way some the activities the president why not the president because and basically wouldnt other think once you become president except under that not what should done but more going the american society that presumably most you would want make try what think are the issues for our country right now and expect that will say something about the fact that lot americans have come here asking for that free asking basically able work hard and live the and like other american citizens they that and just that and thats always been position not only for the who will here but for others well thank you very much
